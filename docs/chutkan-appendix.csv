7,5,"JANUARY 6TH ATTACK ON THE U.S. CAPITOL,"
7,6,"U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"
7,7,"WASHINGTON, D.C."
7,11,"INTERVIEW OF: [x"
7,15,"Thursday, June 2, 2022"
7,17,"Washington, D.C."
7,20,"The interview in the above matter was held in Room 5480, O'Neill House Office"
7,21,"Building, commencing at 10:02 a.m."
7,22,"Present: Representatives Thompson, Aguilar, Schiff, Lofgren, and Cheney."
7,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00764172"
8,1,"In any event, I called and I said, look, you know, what the hell is going on"
8,2,"here? And he said, the trouble is that all these people on the outside, not just J"
8,3,"but others too, are filling the President's ear with all this stuff about fraud, and they're"
8,4,"being very authoritative, and they know how to push the President's buttons, and they're"
8,5,"telling him what he wants to hear, and he seems inclined to believe it or go along with it."
8,6,"And, you know, that -- that is my conversation with Ji”"
8,7,"Ms. Cheney. Thank you very much. I appreciate it."
8,8,"And I'd also like to say hello to {NN who graduated ahead of me at the"
8,9,"University of Chicago."
8,10,"Mr. hm Ahead academically or ahead chronologically?"
8,11,"Ms. Cheney. Academically, not chronologically."
8,12,"Thank you."
8,13,"Mr. SJ I want to turn, Ms. Lofgren, to you. I know you wanted to ask"
8,14,"some questions about that November 23rd and perhaps some other meetings. So let"
8,15,"me give you a chance now to jump in and ask those questions."
8,16,"Ms. Lofgren. Thank you so much."
8,17,"And thanks, Mr. {i for your recounting of these events."
8,18,"Just a quick followup on the November 23rd meeting. You mentioned that the"
8,19,"fraud allegations were not correct. Did you go through the specifics with the President"
8,20,"in the various States at that meeting?"
8,21,"Mr. Hi I don't think I attempted to go through all of them. The one!"
8,22,"specifically remember addressing was -- were the Dominion machines."
8,23,"Ms. Lofgren. Okay."
8,24,"Mr. J And! made the point that it was crazy for them to be wasting their"
8,25,"time on this, because they can be easily checked, because they're tabulation machines,"
8,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00764192"
9,1,"and all you have to do is compare the ballots with the tabulation, and I just thought it was"
9,2,"crazy."
9,3,"And I may have raised other ones with him, but I don't -- I can't really say that I"
9,4,"remember doing that. But I think I probably alluded to some of the other ones."
9,5,"Ms. Lofgren. Okay."
9,6,"In your book, you talk about a December 1st meeting with the President. Can"
9,7,"you tell us about that meeting, who was there and what you said and what others said?"
9,8,"Mr. MB Right."
9,9,"So, I mean, part of the context of that meeting was, after the November 23rd"
9,10,"meeting, I took -- I had talked to some Members on the Hill, Senators and -- more than"
9,11,"one Member, and a lot of people were asking, what do you make of -- you know, what's"
9,12,"going on? Is there going to be a transition? What do you make of these fraud claims?"
9,13,"And one of those calls -- I talked a couple of times, at least, with Senator"
9,14,". (J) and other Senators too. But J expressed concern about where"
9,15,"things were headed, and he said, you know, when I look around, it seems to me that"
9,16,"you're the best person to inject some reality into this situation; I hope you consider"
9,17,"speaking up. And I said that I was planning to do that but I wanted to make sure both as"
9,18,"to the timing and also I wanted to pin down a few more facts."
9,19,"I felt that, number one, if the President after the 23rd was going to become more"
9,20,"realistic, that would affect the timing of when I said something. But, also, I wanted to"
9,21,"make sure that, you know, I didn't say something about that I didn't see any evidence of"
9,22,"fraud and then have something dropped on me that was fairly significant. So I wanted"
9,23,"to do some more due diligence."
9,24,"So, with that as background, you know, I felt that things continued to deteriorate"
9,25,"between the 23rd and the weekend of the 29th. The President started meeting with"
9,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00764193"
10,?,"delegations, and it looked to me there was maneuvering going on. And, you know, I"
10,?,"have no problem with going through the appropriate process to challenge an election"
10,?,"and, you know, through the processes of the courts or the regular processes of the State"
10,?,"government, but I was worried that I didn't have any transpar- -- you know, I didn't have"
10,?,"any visibility into what was going on, but it looked to me that the President was digging"
10,?,"in."
10,?,"And then, on November 29th, he appeared on the Maria Bartiromo show, ""Sunday"
10,?,"Futures"" I believe it was, and he said that the Department was missing in action. And,"
10,?,"you know, I will admit that I was annoyed by a basic dynamic which I actually told my staff"
10,?,"very soon after the election, which is, I didn't think the President would ever admit that"
10,?,"he lost the election, and he would blame it on fraud, and then he would blame the"
10,?,"actions and evidence on the Department of Justice."
10,?,"So I felt all along that people were going to be attacking the Department, saying"
10,?,"that, you know, we had ignored evidence of fraud. And so this got under my skin, but I"
10,?,"also felt it was time for me to say something."
10,?,"So I set up a lunch with the AP reporter Mike Balsamo. And I told him at lunch,"
10,?,"made the statement that, to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could've"
10,?,"effected a different outcome in the election. And I realized, when I said that, that that"
10,?,"was going to be in the news and go national."
10,?,"So I had a later meeting scheduled at the White House at 3 o'clock with J:"
10,?,"this was previously scheduled. So! knew this was going tocome up. And! went over"
10,?,"there, and I told my secretary that I thought I would probably be fired and told not to -- to"
10,?,"go home -- I mean, not go back to my office. So! said, you might have to pack up for"
10,?,"me."
10,?,"And so, when I got over there, I met with the chief of staff. He said the President"

20,4,"SELECT COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE"
20,5,"JANUARY 6TH ATTACK ON THE U.S. CAPITOL,"
20,6,"U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"
20,7,"WASHINGTON, D.C."
20,11,"INTERVIEW OF: [i"
20,15,"Sunday, June 19, 2022"
20,17,"Washington, D.C."
20,20,"The interview in the above matter was held via Webex, commencing at 4:33 p.m."
20,21,"Present: Representative Schiff."
20,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767550"
21,1,"be required in my mind to convince me that there was -- there was sufficient fraud and"
21,2,"sufficient activity that would merit our involvement, no, never found any."
21,3,"Q__ Soit sounds like there were a multitude of claims brought to your attention"
21,4,"by constituents, other members of the House of Representatives, but in your view, there"
21,5,"was no credible evidence to support any of those claims. _ Is that correct?"
21,6,"A That's correct."
21,7,"Q EB I understand that, in late November, or November 22nd to"
21,8,"be specific, you received a phone call from President Trump and in which"
21,9,"they discussed the result of the Presidential election in Arizona with you."
21,10,"Do you recall that conversation?"
21,11,"A Ofcourse."
21,12,"Q_ Can you describe that phone call for us?"
21,13,"A Ican. My wife andI returned from church. We had been in very serious"
21,14,"discussion, EEE and I, for some -- couple weeks, at least, on what we might do"
21,15,"that would help restore confidence generally and defray some of this activity."
21,16,"So we had spoken a lot and when our chief first had called and had asked if I had"
21,17,"received -- been in contact with the White House and I said: No. No."
21,18,"She said: Well, they've been trying to get in touch with me, and I don't know"
21,19,"that they're going to ask, but we at least should be on the same page and have some, you"
21,20,"know, not move, take any motion or make any commitment without talking to each"
21,21,"other."
21,22,"l agreed."
21,23,"And then we said: Well, if you get it, call me back."
21,24,"And immediately, on my Bluetooth in my car, it said that the White House was"
21,25,"calling. And I took that call, and the White House operator asked if I would hold for the"
21,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767558"
22,1,"President, and it was [ who came on and said salutation. And he said that"
22,2,"the President would be with us shortly, and shortly thereafter, the President came on."
22,3,"Q (ERR, can! interrupt you for one second? I just want to clarify."
22,4,"You referenced iD. Is that (NM, the President of the Arizona Senate?"
22,5,"A __ That is correct."
22,6,"Q_ Okay. So {J told you that the President would be coming on the"
22,7,"line, and then he --"
22,8,"A And he shortly did, shortly thereafter he did."
22,9,"Q_ Okay."
22,10,"A Collegial, you know, some small talk. Andthen! said: Well, how can I be"
22,11,"of help?"
22,12,"And, again, in the context -- I support the President, and they said: Well, we are"
22,13,"given to understand -- and I am reconstructing a lot of things in my mind, that is, to my"
22,14,"best memory -- I understand that there are -- there has been a lot of fraud in your"
22,15,"election."
22,16,"And then he proceeded to give classifications, groups of people, a large amount,"
22,17,"60,000 illegal aliens, you know, large numbers, voted in your election, a number of dead"
22,18,"people voted in your election, fraudulent military ballots were counted in your election,"
22,19,"people that voted and moved -- and he had more. _I can't remember all of them"
22,20,"and -- and! said: I you -- J at first, and then it just got down to i -- do"
22,21,"you have -- do you have proof of that?"
22,22,"And they said: Yes."
22,23,"Isaid: Do you have names?"
22,24,"Yes."
22,25,"Can you give those to me?"
22,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767559"
23,1,"Yes."
23,2,"And the President -- and I said: I need more than just numbers. I need proof,"
23,3,"and I need it on my desk. I don't want it -- it's not a thing about a hunch, I think, maybe,"
23,4,"none of that. It has to be proof, names, how they voted, on my desk."
23,5,"Q (QE, can! interrupt you for one moment?"
23,6,"A Ofcourse."
23,7,"Q__ So was the person who started ticking off these claims that there were"
23,8,"60,000 illegal aliens who voted, a number of dead people voted, was that President"
23,9,"Trump or i?"
23,10,"A No, it was i."
23,11,"Q__ Did the President share any of his thoughts or give any input on the specifics"
23,12,"of the claims of election fraud?"
23,13,"A Hedid not, to my recollection. Not to the specifics. He didn't offer any"
23,14,"numbers or anything."
23,15,"Q Soy -"
23,16,"A He did say --"
23,17,"Q_I'msorry."
23,18,"A He did say, because I -- I was insistent that I had to have proof, real proof,"
23,19,"judicial level. That's the kind of proof I'm talking about. And the President said:"
23,20,"HEEB give the man what he wants. Give him what he wants."
23,21,"And QM said: twill. Iwill, We have it."
23,22,"And then he continued in his discussion. AndIsaid: J what's the ask here?"
23,23,"What's the ask?"
23,24,"And the President said: J what's the ask? What do you need from the"
23,25,"speaker?"
23,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767560"
24,1,"And then he said -- of the two issues that I remember most, the first was that he"
24,2,"wanted to have a committee meeting. He wanted the legislature to hold an official"
24,3,"committee and then be able, I would presume, when you say ""official committee,"" I'm"
24,4,"not talking about an interim ad hoc committee, but an official committee of using one of"
24,5,"our standard standing committees to do it."
24,6,"And that's what he said: We'd like to have a committee meeting and review this"
24,7,"proof and this information in a legislative committee. And then, you know, have some"
24,8,"type of established level of recognition of that information."
24,9,"And I said: I will not do that."
24,10,"And we discussed why. AndIsaid: I'm not going to have a circus. And you"
24,11,"know and I know that for me to establish some type of an official report to the legislature"
24,12,"that I should call the legislature into session."
24,13,"And to call them into a special session, I need two-thirds of the members to do"
24,14,"that, and I only have half plus one. The Democrats aren't going to call me into session or"
24,15,"let me go into session. And SJ said, he said: I'm not familiar with all of the laws of"
24,16,"Arizona and the legislature, et cetera."
24,17,"So I just said: You know, people can go out and do an ad hoc committee -- I"
24,18,"mean, and not named by the President, but the speaker or the President, they can go get"
24,19,"a group of people together and talk about it and do what they want. But if you're asking"
24,20,"something to happen in the House, I'm not going to allow that."
24,21,"Q_ So--"
24,22,"A Unless I see myself what it is we're talking about. That was kind of the"
24,23,"flavor of our discussion."
24,24,"Q__ Sol want to cover a couple things that you mentioned there. _ First, you said"
24,25,"that, early part of your answer, you said that the President encouraged EE to"
24,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767561"
25,1,"give you the evidence that you were looking for, and he said he would."
25,2,"Did (MM give you the evidence that you were asking for in that"
25,3,"conversation?"
25,4,"A Not then and not a week later, not 2 weeks later, not now. Never."
25,5,"Q_ Okay. The other thing I want to follow up on, I thought you said that there"
25,6,"were two components to the ask and one of them you've just described, which is that"
25,7,"there be an official committee meeting by a standing committee. What was the other"
25,8,"component of the ask by [EE ?"
25,9,"A __ And then he said in this flowing of the conversation said: We understand"
25,10,"from someone -- and I remember the phrase ""high up in Republican circles"" in the"
25,11,"legislature who said that Arizona law allows for you to call for the dismissal of the Biden"
25,12,"electors and the replacement of those electors by a new slate of electors for President"
25,13,"Trump if there was sufficient cause."
25,14,"And the flavor of the discussion was that the committee meeting would prove"
25,15,"sufficient cause to allow us then to move to number two, which would be the dismissal or"
25,16,"the questioning of the electors that had already been elected. I mean, the vote had"
25,17,"already been taken by the people, you know, 2 and a half weeks earlier."
25,18,"Q_ I'msorry. x, cic EM identify this high up person in"
25,19,"the Republican circles in the legislature?"
25,20,"A He did not. I said: I would very much like to know who that is."
25,21,"And he declined."
25,22,"Q_ So you were the leading Republican in the House as speaker, I assume?"
25,23,"A I presumed I was."
25,24,"Q And J was the leading Republican in the Senate?"
25,25,"A Yes."
25,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767562"
26,1,"Q_ And was she on this phone call with you on November 22nd?"
26,2,"A __ No, sir, she was not."
26,3,"Q Was it your understanding that J was talking about"
26,?,"es:"
26,5,"A No, it was not my understanding."
26,6,"Q_ Okay."
26,7,"A__ They never intimated any more than what I've told you. They never said"
26,8,"anymore. In my view, I know exactly who it was, but I couldn't -- that's just my personal"
26,9,"opinion for who had been pressing this very issue and pressing me to allow him to hold a"
26,10,"committee meeting to review it, and that was J, my Federal relations"
26,11,"chairman."
26,12,"Q (RD, in your view, was there any merit to the position that J"
26,13,"HE or whoever this person was, was pressing on EE that the Arizona State"
26,14,"legislature could disregard Biden electors and install electors for Trump instead?"
26,15,"A At the time -- in fact, when he said that, my response was: Now that's a"
26,16,"new one. I've never heard that one before."
26,17,"And Isaid: You need to tell me more about that."
26,18,"Andhedid. Notthey. He. [ij [Msaid: Well, we're given this"
26,19,"information and that there is a legal theory and there's some legal work."
26,20,"And I said: i can you think of a time that's ever happened in the United"
26,21,"States history?"
26,22,"He said: I personally am not an expert on Arizona law. So it was very general."
26,23,"It was later that I received a treatise -- I may have received it earlier by email, but I never"
26,24,"read it, wherein [ presents it as part of -- and he told -- he personally told me"
26,25,"that that was part of his term paper that he did as part of the legal studies program that"
26,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767563"
27,1,"he was entered in with the University of Arizona."
27,2,"And it also later came to my attention that [I had had some"
27,3,"information that was used by EE as a, you know, legal theory upon which to"
27,4,"base his paper and that he cited in his paper."
27,5,"But I had not any other clue other than that initial, you know, claim by"
27,6,"HM And he -- he backed right up. I mean, he didn't try to give me scripture and"
27,7,"verse where in Arizona statute. And he would have been way off, because the claim is"
27,8,"against Article Il, section 1, clause 2, about the legislative powers."
27,9,"But that was what he had said, and I just said: I I you're asking me to do"
27,10,"something that is beyond anything I have ever heard or contemplated as a constitutional"
27,11,"prerogative or choice that I might take. And I will do nothing, nothing that will put my"
27,12,"State at risk or cast a bad reputation on my State or on my body unless I know a lot more"
27,13,"about it and that I have competent legal -- and not necessarily from this conversation. I"
27,14,"said: I'm not going to go willy-nilly off and take some kind of decision without good"
27,15,"legal counsel on this issue, and I have some good lawyers. And -- and, in fact, I will -- I"
27,16,"may have gone beyond what you want me to answer, J."
27,17,"Q  No,no. That's fine. So just to summarize."
27,18,"So, SE, the second part of his ask -- the first part was that you convene a"
27,19,"special -- or you bring the committee back into session, an official committee."
27,20,"And the second ask was that the State legislature consider disregarding the Biden"
27,21,"electors and install the electors for Trump instead."
27,22,"And, on that second ask, you told him you never heard of such a thing, right?"
27,23,"A I never heard of such an authority or thing ever."
27,24,"Q_ And you shared your skepticism with [is ?"
27,25,"A I did."
27,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767564"
28,1,"Q_ And sorry?"
28,2,"A Strongly. Andhe said: Well, you know, we're all kind of Republicans and"
28,3,"we need to be working together."
28,4,"And I said -- I mean, that was, you know, those little snippets would be in the"
28,5,"conversation and I know when I'm being worked. _I mean, I've only been at it for a while."
28,6,"And I know he's trying to work me to a point. And I believe that one -- one point the"
28,7,"President said: We're just asking you to investigate. Just look into it."
28,8,"And -- and I said: _ I will give you the number of my attorney right now."
28,9,"But I said: I have seen people do that on their cell phones, but I'm not real"
28,10,"familiar with it, and, Mr. President, I can't even tweet on this thing and watch; it'll be me"
28,11,"telling my grandkids that me trying to do this, and I hung up on the President of the"
28,12,"United States."
28,13,"And Isaid: But I'll try."
28,14,"He said: Well, go for it."
28,15,"The President said: Well, go for it."
28,16,"And so I did, and that's exactly what I did. I disconnected us. I hung up on him."
28,17,"Q_ You're a man of your word."
28,18,"A I follow through. And then J immediately called me back and"
28,19,"said, hey -- he was laughing, and he said: Hey, the President, he's a great guy. He was"
28,20,"laughing like crazy. He said: You know that really is funny."
28,21,"And so then we went on. And_I got right back to dead serious. Isaid: Just"
28,22,"remember, [E, you said you had proof, and! wantit. You bring me the proof"
28,23,"of all these things you say are real."
28,24,"Q_ Sorry. And is that how you sort of left things at the end of that"
28,25,"conversation?"
28,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767565"
29,1,"A Yeah. It kind of ended that way. He said he would. I said: I'll have my"
29,2,"lawyer get in touch with you. You can expect his call, and I expect you to call him."
29,3,"And I gave him the number, and that's how we left the phone."
29,4,"Q_ And I think you've already said that you didn't get the proof that you had"
29,5,"requested and that he had promised?"
29,6,"A Thatis correct. Nor did he ever call NJ. He never made that call."
29,7,"Q___lIunderstand that, a week or so after that call -- yes?"
29,8,"HE. just wanted a couple of followup questions, is."
29,9,"a:"
29,10,"Q__ Just to clarify, did the President participate in the entirety of the phone call?"
29,11,"A Yes."
29,12,"Q Okay. And did you hear him ever challenge or dispute what JES"
29,13,"was saying to you?"
29,14,"A No."
29,15,"Q_ Okay. And you mentioned that in part of your -- part of your discussion"
29,16,"here with us today that one of the second ask that you described about replacing the"
29,17,"electors in Arizona, the Biden electors with Trump electors, that you now understand that"
29,18,"the source of this argument was in the United States Constitution."
29,19,"Did that come up during the call at that time, or is that something that you've"
29,20,"understood later?"
29,21,"A No. It did not come up in the call; it was later."
29,22,"Q Okay. So, at the time of this call in November 2020, all that [iy"
29,23,"was asserting to you was that someone from Arizona Republican circles had told him that"
29,24,"there was an Arizona law that would provide you an avenue to replace the electors. Is"
29,25,"that right?"
29,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767566"
30,1,"A Yes. That's correct."
30,2,"Q_ And did the President make any comment about that assertion by"
30,?,";"
30,4,"A Hedid not."
30,5,"Q_ Okay."
30,6,"HR. Thank you."
30,7,"HE... Schiff?"
30,8,"Mr. Schiff. Yes, thank you, [."
30,9,"Mr. Speaker, once again, thank you for spending part of your Father's Day with us"
30,10,"this way. I just wanted to follow up and make sure that weren't leaving anything out."
30,11,"Can you tell us, as best you can recall, each of the times the President spoke up during the"
30,12,"conversation and what he had to say?"
30,13,"HE Generally, I even thought, is this like a good cop, bad cop thing,"
30,14,"because he would say: I give him what he needs. Tell him what you need."
30,15,"What's the ask? We'll call the lawyer. Things like that."
30,16,"It was never -- and then one time he said, ""We would just like you to investigate"
30,17,"this,"" which was, in my view, I understood that to check it out: We'd like to ask you if"
30,18,"you would check it out."
30,19,"HE (What did the President say to you when he first got on the line with"
30,20,"you?"
30,21,"WU MCs said: = Mr. Speaker, I've heard a lot about you. You know, the"
30,22,"pat on the back stuff. We -- we'd like to talk with you about something that we've been"
30,23,"thinking about."
30,24,"He didn't go right to any point, but it was kind of a general introduction, some"
30,25,"niceties, and then he turned it over to"
30,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767567"
31,?,"Mr. Schiff. And what was the rest of the pat on the back stuff? Do you recall?"
31,?,"QR. That he had heard that I was doing a great job. He did -- we"
31,?,"did -- we had met when he had come to campaign, and we -- you know, we met him"
31,?,"coming down from Air Force One and went to an event with him and he gave the, you"
31,?,"know, the call to the stage and that kind of stuff."
31,?,"So we had met and it was more like, you know, we really appreciate Arizona. It's"
31,?,"a great State, great people, that kind of -- it was like campaign talk."
31,?,"Mr. Schiff. So, when you said that you campaigned for him in the 2020 election,"
31,?,"you actually campaigned with him at times?"
31,?,"HE. cic."
31,?,"Mr. Schiff. And was that more than once or what was the nature --"
31,?,"a. I only recall one campaign -- large campaign event where we went."
31,?,"And then I walked for the campaign and passed out flyers and, you know, went door to"
31,?,"door, things like that."
31,?,"Mr. Schiff. Wow. So you actually as the speaker of the House of"
31,?,"Representatives in Arizona, you went door to door precinct, walking for President Trump?"
31,?,"HE. 4c anc SR, yes, that's correct."
31,?,"Mr. Schiff. So, on the phone call after the pleasantries and the pat on the back,"
31,?,"he basically turns it over to [J to make the requests?"
31,?,"HR. That's correct."
31,?,"Mr. Schiff. And, you know, as {I is asking you to call the legislature into"
31,?,"session so that he can present whatever evidence he has or suggesting to you that the"
31,?,"legislature can somehow decertify the Biden electors or appoint Trump electors, is the"
31,?,"President commenting on this along the way?"
31,?,"H.-N. I don't ever remember him saying, like ""that's right"" or ""yes"""
31,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767568"
32,?,"or ""well said,"" nothing like that, never."
32,?,"Mr. Schiff. So his interjections were mostly to, as you say, good cop/bad cop to"
32,?,"prompt i to tell you exactly what he wants you to do?"
32,?,"HE. That is -- that is my recollection, Mr. Schiff. That's my"
32,?,"recollection, yes."
32,?,"Mr. Schiff. And, on the first ask, (NN wanted you to reconvene the"
32,?,"legislature so he could present you with what he claimed was evidence of these"
32,?,"allegations of fraud, but you weren't willing to do that without seeing some -- some"
32,?,"substance to these allegations. Is that right?"
32,?,"HEE. Representative, my recollection is that he wanted a committee"
32,?,"meeting at the legislature. It was my view that if we're going to have some official"
32,?,"outcome to this committee, that we would have to be in session, and that I talked about"
32,?,"that."
32,?,"But the committee meeting, the hope was for that so that they could present al! of"
32,?,"these cases, whatever it was that they had in an official capacity, establish an official"
32,?,"record for whatever use they felt that was necessary. That's my -- that was my"
32,?,"understanding."
32,?,"Mr. Schiff. And if I understood correctly, you had two strong objections to that?"
32,?,"One was you wanted to see some evidence first?"
32,?,"HR. That's correct."
32,?,"Mr. Schiff. And, second, in the absence of that evidence, it was going to be"
32,?,"impossible to convince enough of the legislature, the two-thirds needed to bring it back"
32,?,"into some session?"
32,?,"HE. think -- I had not thought that, but I think that is true. In my"
32,?,"view -- see, they have to vote. I can't callthemin. We can --I can say we're going to"
32,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767569"
33,?,"meet on X date and you'll vote whether you come in or not. They have to vote to come"
33,?,"in."
33,?,"And we have only called, I believe, the legislature has called itself into session one"
33,?,"time, and that was like in 1981 or -3, and it was to override a veto of the Governor."
33,?,"So I have no practical knowledge of the A, B, C, Ds of calling the legislature into"
33,?,"session. And that -- we would just rely on the established protocols, but I knew that I"
33,?,"had to have nine Democrats ascent to calling us into session."
33,?,"We had been fighting this battle for over a year on the COVID issue where they"
33,?,"wanted me to call them into session, repel the Governor's autocratic rule, et cetera."
33,?,"And this had been a subject of hundreds, thousands of emails over the last period of"
33,?,"COVID time when we were out of session, couldn't meet, you know, many of the"
33,?,"problems that the whole country was going through."
33,?,"So that point was, again, presented to me that I was just going to call us into"
33,?,"session, and I wanted to clarify to him how that would have to happen."
33,?,"Mr. Schiff. And, Mr. Speaker, can you tell us, again, as best you recall exactly"
33,?,"what -- what his second request was, that is, what he was arguing you could do to"
33,?,"either decertify the Biden electors, appoint Trump electors? What was he asking you to"
33,?,"do? What did he believe you had the power to do?"
33,?,"HS. The bridge between the first point and the second point was me"
33,?,"saying: Towhatend? What'stheend? I get the ask of the committee, but to what"
33,?,"end? Where are we going with this? What's the end?"
33,?,"And he said: Well, we understood that there's this thing where you would be"
33,?,"able to decertify."
33,?,"And we got into the second ask."
33,?,"And that was exactly it, that I would decertify because of obvious fraud, you know,"
33,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767570"
34,1,"things like that."
34,2,"Mr. Schiff. And by ""decertify"" you mean, he was asking --"
34,3,"HR. Decertify the electors’ position and decertify the election and allow"
34,4,"for the certification of a new slate of electors to go to Washington to represent Arizona"
34,5,"and our vote."
34,6,"Mr. Schiff. So his second ask was for you to call the legislature and to decertify"
34,7,"the electors for Biden, recertify electors for Trump, and send those to Washington?"
34,8,"HE. That's correct. That's as I understood it, yes."
34,9,"Mr. Schiff. And your response to him was what?"
34,10,"HR. That'sanewone. I'd never heard that one before, you know, as"
34,11,"far as some off-the-wall thing. said: Has that ever been done before?"
34,12,"He said: I really don't know. You know, I'm not familiar with Arizona law."
34,13,"He did kind of a pivot."
34,14,"And then I said: You're asking me to do something that has never been done"
34,15,"before, that's supposedly constitutional, and I swore an oath to the Constitution of the"
34,16,"United States, and I also swore an oath to the constitution and laws of my State, and I'm"
34,17,"going to just willy-nilly do this?"
34,18,"Isaid: No. lamnotgoingto. I swore an oath."
34,19,"And asked: Whose oath should I honor? Should I honor the United States?"
34,20,"Should I honor the State? I swore an oath to both."
34,21,"And he said: The United States Constitution trumps -- trumps the State"
34,22,"constitution."
34,23,"I said, I was -- I'll admit I was a little bit frustrated by now, and I said: I will not do"
34,24,"any such thing without sufficient proof, but also without sufficient -- I'm not going to do"
34,25,"this willy-nilly and make some commitment on the phone."
34,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767571"
35,1,"That kind of thing, you know. I thought somebody's trying to sell me a used car."
35,2,"Q__ That they didn't even have on the lot?"
35,3,"A __ They certainly didn't have any proof. When he came, he said he would"
35,4,"bring the proof. He didn't bring the proof, but he did bring COVID. That's about the"
35,5,"only thing that's lasted in Arizona. _ I've never seen any proof."
35,6,"Q__Doyou recall any specific allegations? _I know there was no proof, but do"
35,7,"you recall specific allegations that were made --"
35,8,"A Oh, yes."
35,9,"Q_ --at this meeting?"
35,10,"A Again, I don't remember -- like if he said 6,000 dead people or 60,000 dead"
35,11,"people or a huge number of illegal aliens and I mean large. _I think one time he said that"
35,12,"you have 5 million illegal aliens in this State and Senator J said: J we've only got"
35,13,"7 million people in the State. Are you telling me that 5 million of them are illegal aliens?"
35,14,"And it was not -- it was nota little Sunday school class meeting. I was a very -- it"
35,15,"was a very tough meeting."
35,16,"Q_ And I think you've referenced --"
35,17,"A I'm sorry."
35,18,"Q_ Go ahead, as."
35,19,"A I was done."
35,20,"Q___ I think you said earlier that, in response to Mr. Schiff's questions, that"
35,21,"J took note of the fact that the -- that it was somewhat of a tense and he called"
35,22,"hostile meeting."
35,23,"A __ Atleast twice, if not more, but at least twice and specifically would say:"
35,24,"Man, I thought we were all Republicans. This is -- this is -- this is a little more hostile a"
35,25,"reception. I'm amazed at the reception I'm getting here."
35,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767577"
36,?,"where a President's electors could be replaced. And then she opined, you know. She"
36,?,"gave her opinions on the subject."
36,?,"One thing was, because we -- I had pushed for evidence: Have you got the"
36,?,"evidence?"
36,?,"I remember, I don't know if it was just an off-the-cuff comment or what, but"
36,?,"he -- NJ said something like: We have -- we don't have the evidence, but we"
36,?,"have lots of theories."
36,?,"And I -- in retrospect, I think, at least he said that right, you know. But it was -- it"
36,?,"was something that he had said that we later, we all looked at each other and said: Did"
36,?,"he really say that?"
36,?,"Yes, he did."
36,?,"So it was an illuminative moment, which he went on at length."
36,?,"And I seem -- you know, as} think of it.now..thatls.ane of the things that J"
36,?,"really went after was the idea of throwing out the election and -- I'm sorry, not"
36,?,"HE, that he really went after that point. That was an"
36,?,"exercised point."
36,?,"Q Understood. Thank you."
36,?,"A __ Thank you."
36,?,"Ho. Schiff?"
36,?,"Mr. Schiff. Thank you."
36,?,"Mr. Speaker, on December 4th, you released a statement publicly addressing,"
36,?,"quote, calls for the legislature to overturn the 2020 certified election results. The"
36,?,"statement was very straightforward in explaining the breathtaking request made by"
36,?,"representatives of President Trump, quote, that the Arizona legislature overturn the"
36,?,"certified results of last month's election and delivered the State's electoral college votes"
36,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767585"
37,1,"Q Okay."
37,2,"A --lunderstand."
37,3,"Q__ Did he -- did he try to tell you that what he was asking of you was not illegal?"
37,4,"A He never mentioned anything about what he asked, from my recollection,"
37,5,"which is why it was kind of surrealto me. I thought, wow."
37,6,"Q_ Okay. Thank you."
37,7,"mT"
37,8,"Q On December 4th, did you have a call with {, another attorney"
37,9,"working for the President on his efforts to oppose the election results?"
37,10,"A Yes."
37,11,"Q__ How did that call come about?"
37,12,"ER. 'msorry. I just want to interject. I think that you asked the"
37,13,"question whether it was on December 4th. I think you meant January."
37,14,"BY a:"
37,15,"Q_ Thank you, Counsel. I did misspeak."
37,16,"On January 4th, you had a call with i?"
37,17,"A Ido remember speaking with NN. I'm not -- let me -- yes, I see it"
37,18,"in mynotes. Yes, that meeting did occur."
37,19,"Q__ How did that call come about?"
37,20,"A We had been pressed by and others for me to talk to"
37,21,"[EE (ph) to - in the hopes of convincing me of the"
37,22,"constitutional quality of taking an action about having a committee meeting or"
37,23,"doing -- now, it was shifted more to -- let's see -- yes, more to the electors, and that there"
37,24,"was this, you know, high-level legal minds and decisions on this, not court decisions, but"
37,25,"legal decisions, you know, thoughts, papers, and that I should talk to [, one"
37,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767592"
38,1,"of the highest constitutional lawyers in the country. Andsolsaid, sure. I shouldn't say"
38,2,"lsaid sure. That sounds flippant. Iacquiesced. Isaid: I would like to know if there"
38,3,"is any evidence that anybody has and if there's any legal precedence or thoughts on the"
38,4,"issue."
38,5,"And that -- and so EE -- I don't know, but I was told"
38,6,"«© [knew from sometime back in California when he was a"
38,7,"candidate for attorney general, knew him from other associations. And he talked to me"
38,8,"about the man, and that he was, you know, he had a reputation, and that it would be"
38,9,"good at least to hear it. I mean, he would -- nobody was a cheerleader for the"
38,10,"conversation, but -- I mean, on my staff. There were cheerleaders but not from my"
38,11,"staff. And so we took that call."
38,12,"Q_ Can you describe the phone call for us?"
38,13,"A It was lengthy. And --"
38,14,"Q_ Well, how about a very high-level summary of what was covered in the call"
38,15,"with SE on January 4th."
38,16,"A Well, one of the things was about what the plenary power of authority of the"
38,17,"legislature would be and where we would secure that. We talked about the -- the only"
38,18,"other kind of a close decision in the area of Article Il was the Hawaii case with President"
38,19,"Nixon and Mr. -- and President Kennedy and how those two competing groups ended up"
38,20,"being a factor."
38,21,"And -- but the -- but the principle that I -- we -- I talked about was that, as it was"
38,22,"explained, I said, but the issue wasn't whether or not there was fraud; the issue was -- is"
38,23,"that -- well, there might have been. Who knows. The issue was that you had a"
38,24,"recount, a mandatory recount because the vote was within the margin of error, or it was"
38,25,"within the margin of Hawaiian law, and so they had a recount. And, in the recount, the"
38,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767593"
39,1,"vote flipped."
39,2,"And so now you had already chosen one group and now another one went back,"
39,3,"and how ironic it was that the Vice President would be the President of the Senate and"
39,4,"would take the decision and chose for Kennedy, and -- but that showed -- it was the"
39,5,"pleading of ( that that showed that the powers of the legislature were such"
39,6,"that they could reach into that arena."
39,7,"And we talked about how much illegal evidence would have to be present just to"
39,8,"decertify or to -- and the timeline when that would have to happen. We talked about"
39,9,"the investigations being ongoing; we haven't yet determined whether any illegal votes"
39,10,"even affected the outcome, and yet we should take this decision, and that shouldn't we"
39,11,"at least get some resolution to the amount of fraud necessary in order to even get the"
39,12,"resolution to decertify the electors?"
39,13,"And a lot of things were talked -- and his general outtake was that: It's a difficult"
39,14,"decision. _ It's -- but the power does lie with you."
39,15,"And Isaid: But it doesn't lie with me solely. __ It's -- again, back to Arizona law"
39,16,"and how you can't just pull yourself into session."
39,17,"And I'm sure he understood that nine Democrats weren't going to come marching"
39,18,"down there and vote to decertify their own President's candidate or the electors and how"
39,19,"it's impossible."
39,20,"And he said, well, then -- I think part of the discussion was: Well, don't use"
39,21,"them. Youdon'tneedthem. You just needa majority. Call a majority together."
39,22,"That's a majority of the legislature. Take the decision. Let the courts sort it out."
39,23,"And --"
39,24,"Q_ So--"
39,25,"A Goahead."
39,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767594"
40,?,"Q_ Canlinterrupt you there? I want to break down some of the things that"
40,?,"you said there. When you -- when you -- let me ask you this way. Did you tell"
40,?,"HER 50) the call that you had still not received the proof of the claims of fraud that"
40,?,"had been made and even though it had been promised to you by EE On multiple"
40,?,"occasions?"
40,?,"A ___I-- it would make sense that I did, because I kept saying when are we going"
40,?,"to get this proof to everybody."
40,?,"I got a notice that my battery is running low and so my image is going to stall for"
40,?,"just a second while I put this thing in."
40,?,"HR. Go right ahead."
40,?,"GE. ct's go off the record for just a second."
40,?,"[Recess.]"
40,?,"a"
40,?,"Q_ We'll go back on the record."
40,?,"A Again --"
40,?,"Q So, NS, cid -- how did {J respond when you told him"
40,?,"that you still didn't have proof of the claims of election fraud that you had been"
40,?,"demanding?"
40,?,"A I think he kind of laid out a course of steps of what they would -- of what was"
40,?,"being asked in this conversation. It wasn't only a conversation to inform me. It was a"
40,?,"conversation to get somewhere."
40,?,"Q__ So what were the --"
40,?,"A _ The first was that we would -- that we would certify an alternative slate -- an"
40,?,"alternate slate of electors and that if there isn't enough evidence of illegal votes to throw"
40,?,"the election to Biden and that he was asking to certify another slate of electors."
40,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767595"
41,1,"Q_ Was there some alternative that he offered or suggested?"
41,2,"A And then the second was, if investigations -- I'm reading from the note: If"
41,3,"investigations are ongoing and the legislature can't yet determine whether illegal votes"
41,4,"affected the outcome of the election, then at least get a resolution that decertifies the"
41,5,"existing slate."
41,6,"So both -- both one and two focused on a justification of sorts to decertify. And"
41,7,"then, if that wasn't enough, that at least -- we -- J had passed around a letter,"
41,8,"which I vociferously and strongly asked my colleagues, please, get off the letter campaign"
41,9,"where everybody has to -- is being asked to sign on whatever it might be to asking"
41,10,"this -- the counties to do that, sending a letter to Congress. This just divides us and"
41,11,"hurts -- it's going to be used in campaigns that you didn't do this and you didn't do that"
41,12,"and why didn't you stand up -- so that -- here we came again that I would -- I was being"
41,13,"asked by EE to sign a letter from J that he had circulated asking"
41,14,"Mr. Pence to not certify the election and to do that before the 6th of January. That was"
41,15,"the third ask. If you can't decertify them or are not willing to decertify them, blah, blah,"
41,16,"blah, at least be willing to sign on to ask Pence not to certify until sufficient information"
41,17,"can be obtained in the lack of evidence, you know, at least hold it off, it's too quick type"
41,18,"of thing."
41,19,"BY a:"
41,20,"Q_ Thank you, J. And did you respond to i"
41,21,"suggestions of these possible courses of action for you in a similar manner as you did"
41,22,"when similar suggestions were made by iy. including on that first phone call"
41,23,"with President Trump?"
41,24,"A Yes. Again, we went through my oath and that I wasn't going to"
41,25,"experiment with my oath, that I -- that mentality. I wasn't going to play with the oath of"
41,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767596"
42,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER"
42,?,"office, that I could see that the explanation, there is a part of the Constitution that might"
42,?,"be construed to give an authority. It's never been used. And nowit's the time for me"
42,?,"to have the courage to stand up and declare what it means, and that I was going -- me"
42,?,"and my State, we were going to take this previously unused stance at a time of enormous"
42,?,"consequence, and that I wasn't going to do that, that in the absence of proof that would"
42,?,"get me even pause that I wasn't going to take such an action."
42,?,"Q__ And, notwithstanding your response to i, did he"
42,?,"nonetheless still encourage you to take some action and allow the courts to sort it out?"
42,?,"A Thatis correct. He just said: Well, just do it and let the courts sort it"
42,?,"through. Let it work through the courts."
42,?,"And I just said: Yeah, I'm not going to do that. I appreciate, you know, the call,"
42,?,"et cetera, but we're not going to -- I'm not going to play with my State, and I'm not going"
42,?,"to play with the oath. We're not going to do that."
42,?,"Q Understood. I'm sorry --"
42,?,"A Andso that wasit. I did ask him --"
42,?,"HE, ou connection is not very good right now --"
42,?,"-- okay. Can you hear me?"
42,?,"Yes. That's much better. Wesee you now."
42,?,"> Pp F LY"
42,?,"Okay."
42,?,"Q_ We lost just a little bit of your answer. I know that you were responding to"
42,?,"my question, that I believe I heard you say that I did recommended that you"
42,?,"nonetheless take some action and allow the courts to sort it out. And I believe that I"
42,?,"heard you say that he encouraged you to just do it and let them -- let the --"
42,?,"A Yes. Just go ahead, just do it and let the courts -- I said: Seriously, with all"
42,?,"that we've talked about, really, what would you recommend that I would do?"
43,?,"And he said: I would just do it and let the courts sort it out."
43,?,"Isaid: We're not going to do that. I'm not going to take that."
43,?,"Q Understood. Just two other quick questions about that call, i"
43,?,"HE One, did SY represent himself to be representing President Trump"
43,?,"in -- when he spoke with you?"
43,?,"A Whether he did or not, I understood that he was one of Mr, Trump's"
43,?,"counsel, a team, a counsel, yes."
43,?,"Q_ Okay. Thank you."
43,?,"A I don't remember him saying ""I'm President Trump's lawyer,"" but he -- he"
43,?,"may have, but I totally understood him to be representing him -- representing the"
43,?,"President's position and the White House."
43,?,"Q- Okay. Thank you."
43,?,"And at any time either on this phone call with EM or in any of your other"
43,?,"discussions with folks representing or associated with President Trump, did any of them"
43,?,"ever raise the prospect of there already being a Trump slate of electors, that the electors"
43,?,"for Trump and Pence had, in fact, met in Arizona on December 14th and signed"
43,?,"documents purporting to represent the duly elected electors from Arizona?"
43,?,"A Is the question that in a conversation with EE or IJ or any of"
43,?,"them that that point came up, no."
43,?,"Q- Okay. Were --"
43,?,"A __ Itdidn't seem to be important. I knew about these things in the general"
43,?,"course of reporting and in the -- you know, learning -- going through this process in a very"
43,?,"heightened way, but, no, it was never mentioned to any particular end that I recall."
43,?,"Q_ Okay. And what was your assessment having learned that there"
43,?,"were -- that there was this slate of Trump-Pence electors who had met in Phoenix and,"
43,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767598"
44,1,"you know, purported to cast votes to elect Trump and Pence in the electoral college, what"
44,2,"was your assessment of whether that was legal or appropriate?"
44,3,"A I thought it was totally foolish and -- but it falls right in line with some of the"

44,6,"for sure."
44,7,"Q Understood. And is it fair to say that you did not think that they had any"
44,8,"legal effect?"
44,9,"A __ So far from it that it would be a charade. It wasacharadetome. Andit"
44,10,"was -- it just reinforced that the train gets rolling and it's like people don't realize they're"
44,11,"ona train and that they ought to be pulling the brakes or getting off this train, but it just"
44,12,"keeps right on rolling. So what's the next thing that we could do on our crazy train?"
44,13,"And I get it -- I get alittle flippant. I'msorry. I know this is -- I just think that"
44,14,"these things are -- it's almost juvenile our responses, that -- we elected an elector, yet I'm"
44,15,"going to just say: Hey, I think I'll be an elector, and I'll just head on down there and sign"
44,16,"up."
44,17,"None of them were even elected. Who would elect them? We didn't have an"
44,18,"election. It was just -- so how one might volunteer to take the place of duly elected"
44,19,"electors, I'm -- I wish it hadn't been that way. I wish that the original electors for Trump,"
44,20,"that's not the point. They were Mr. Biden's -- okay. It was -- it was foolish. It was"
44,21,"very foolish."
44,22,"Q Understood. Thankyou forthat. We appreciate your perspective."
44,23,"a"
44,24,"Q___I want to move to a separate -- or another phone conversation that you had,"
44,25,"HE, 21 that's a couple days later on January 6th. Did you get a call from"
44,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767599"
45,1,"Q_ There was --"
45,2,"A We talked about it in fraud, and! said: No,no,no,no,no,no,no. There"
45,3,"is only one place that I think that the manner of electing electors was compromised, and"
45,4,"that was by the Federal judge who pushed the registration period into the voting periods,"
45,5,"and that's contrary to Arizona law, and that's contrary to the manner."
45,6,"But it was for 5 days, and before they could get it all stopped, I think it was almost"
45,7,"10 days. Within that period of time, I asked: Is there any way we can know"
45,8,"who -- who all was involved and how many, et cetera, et cetera."
45,9,"My initial recollection was that there were not enough registrations that one"
45,10,"might consider would vote for Trump or Mr. Biden enough to cover the gap."
45,11,"Q = Understood. I think you mentioned this earlier, and I just want to ask you if"
45,12,"you could provide a little bit more detail on it. And 1 don't mean to sort of dwell ona"
45,13,"situation that I'm sure was troubling for you, but you mentioned the fact of protesters"
45,14,"calling between election day and January 6th being quite active and harassing of you."
45,15,"Can you tell us a little bit about what that involved?"
45,16,"A Well, aside from the Capitol, because at the Capitol there was a constant"
45,17,"presence, including a guy that walks -- strolled into the Senate and stood up on the dais,"
45,18,"the QAnon Shaman dude. He was -- I was one of his favorite targets for his rhetoric at"
45,19,"the Capitol."
45,20,"But, when we came to my home, when people started showing up at my home"
45,21,"with bullhorns and with loud speakers and with panel trucks with videos on the side and"
45,22,"with a large military looking civilian vehicle and lines of cars honking and screaming and"
45,23,"then crowding at the end of my driveway, and I'll just say irritating, but it was a real pain"
45,24,"to all my neighbors. They'd come down and say, i lam -- I am so far different"
45,25,"from you than the man on the moon politically, I'm as liberal as you could ever be, but I"
45,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767601"
46,1,"know you're not a pedophile,"" which was one of the things that they'd put up on their"
46,2,"video trucks as they went by."
46,3,"And this was -- I couldn't ever -- I never went out to interview them and say:"
46,4,"Now, exactly who sent you today?"
46,5,"But part of it was from a group called the Patriot Party of Arizona. They'd call"
46,6,"themselves that and have tried to become a separate party. ANN, he was"
46,7,"very active in agitating on social media and in person, et cetera. There were the"
46,8,"people -- different groups. I know that he specifically did that, but I -- again, I don't"
46,9,"know all of who came or why. I just know they came."
46,10,"And, ultimately, that went over a period of months with some regularity, you"
46,11,"know. I think there was nine times totally that they came, with the ninth time being"
46,12,"rather recent. But it was -- I have a whole different view. I have been in some"
46,13,"situations in my life, pretty tough. And they just seemed like unhinged, you know, the"
46,14,"screaming and the yelling and the loudspeakers broadcasting my perversions to the"
46,15,"neighborhood and that I was, you know, horrible, on the take, corrupt, all this."
46,16,"When they stopped, when actual people got out and started to come on my"
46,17,"property, I would say, ""Don't come on my property,"" you know, loudly. They kept"
46,18,"coming: Don't come on my property. Go back."
46,19,"And they never rushed the place. They did -- somebody did come in and cut my"
46,20,"Christmas lights, you know. Okay. That's pretty juvenile. And it wasn't like antifa."
46,21,"They were -- you know, might get a little more directed. But the police would always"
46,22,"come. Theyhad spotters. So, when they spotted the police, they would call, and"
46,23,"everybody would kind of flee like quail."
46,24,"And then -- but one -- at the end, there was a gentleman, a Three Percenter. He"
46,25,"had it on his T-shirt. It was on his car, and he had a pistol. And when! -- I was already"
46,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00767602"
47,?,"so close but not close enough, and so! got closer. I got closer, because if he pulled that"
47,?,"out, I had to be close enough to get onhim. I mean, why would I even have to think"
47,?,"that standing on my own property, but that's what I thought. And just vain, vile,"
47,?,"screaming at me and my neighbors."
47,?,"And so then one of them, a lady hit my neighbor with her car, and he flipped up"
47,?,"on the hood, and she just kept right on going. And, later on, she sent the police because"
47,?,"he damaged her car. We'd say: Well, that's cool. We --she came to you. That's"
47,?,"the lady that hit my neighbor, you know."
47,?,"It just was so -- it was -- and the cops would say: Did you ever feel threatened?"
47,?,"Isaid: Well, yeah."
47,?,"My wife said: Yeah, I did."
47,?,"And, at the same time, we had a daughter who was very, very ill and inside and"
47,?,"wondering what was all the noise and causing her disruption and angst. And the whole"
47,?,"thing was just -- it was very unsettling."
47,?,"I never felt like I was in imminent danger, per se, but in those situations all it takes"
47,?,"is one of them to think: I'm going to prove that I'm a great patriot and so I'm going to"
47,?,"pull out a gun and shoot this guy."
47,?,"I mean, those thoughts came to my mind because they have happened. And so"
47,?,"that's, you know -- it was unsettling."
47,?,"Q_ And has this continued, I mean, past January 2021?"
47,?,"A Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
47,?,"Q_ To this day?"
47,?,"A Well, none recently. The last one was a couple of months ago-ish. You"
47,?,"know, I don't -- I have a journal somewhere, but I don't have it with me. And it"
47,?,"broke -- it ebbed off for a while, but it just became less frequent. There is only nine in"

128,2,"President about whether he should declare victory, whether he should that say he won"

128,4,"A What do you mean by participate? Like I say that because in that big"
128,5,"meeting, those conversations were happening when they were discussing his remarks."
128,6,"We all know what his remarks were."
128,7,"Q_ Right."
128,8,"A __ And there were definitely conversations about that in that big meeting. I"
128,9,"don't think I ever weighed in other than giving an update on where we stood with respect"
128,10,"to the count."
128,11,"I don't think I ever said you should say this or you should say that or you shouldn't"

128,13,"remarks, but went I present there when those conversations were being had, the answer"
128,14,"is yes."
128,15,"Q Just going back to, you know, I hear you saying you don't think you weighed"
128,16,"in about whether or not he should say that he had won the election, but in the course of"
128,17,"your providing an update on the status of counting and the status of the election, did you"
128,18,"tell the President that he had won?"
128,19,"A No. I wouldn't have said that."
128,20,"Q 9 Okay. What would you have said?"
128,21,"A I would have said we -- I would have told him the truth, which I always did,"
128,22,"which was at the time like, Hey, this still looks really good, like I don't know where this is"
128,23,"going to come out tomorrow, and I gave him the update that I just gave you: Georgia,"
128,24,"we hada lead. Pennsylvania, there was still way to many ballots outstanding. I"
128,25,"thought they called Arizona wrong. There were issues with the absentee ballots in"
128,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00771611"
129,?,"Wisconsin that we needed to deal and would deal with."
129,?,"So it was still open. It was an open question."
129,?,"Q_ Okay. Open question as to the outcome?"
129,?,"A What I would have said is, you know, I don't think this thing is over by a long"
129,?,"shot. I would have said that to him, something along those lines. I don't remember"
129,?,"the specific words that I used, but that's what I would have said."
129,?,"Q_ Okay. So for the rest of the conversation, even if you weren't asked or"
129,?,"didn't actually weigh in about what he should say, but in the rest of that group"
129,?,"conversation, did anyone advocate for a different position than what would be the"
129,?,"natural implication of what you just said, which is that -- like you just told us, that it's not"
129,?,"over by a long shot yet?"
129,?,"Were there other voices advocating that it was over?"
129,?,"A I don't remember that. Everyone would have looked to me or to BB."
129,?,"Frankly, they would have looked to if he didn't go ahead and get COVID that night,"
129,?,"but they would have looked to us to say what the status of the race was, and I don't think"
129,?,"there was any daylight between what Hi and I thought about where the race was at that"
129,?,"moment."
129,?,"Q_ Gotit. So is it fair to say that you don't remember anyone giving an"
129,?,"assessment or advice to the President that was different than what you and your"
129,?,"colleagues viewed, which was that it was still possible to win, but it was still tight and the"
129,?,"election was not over yet?"
129,?,"A I don't think anyone --no. No one would have said that. They would"
129,?,"have gotten an earful from me and I - because nobody in that room was from the"
129,?,"political department or the field department to count votes. Noonehadaccess. They"
129,?,"could talk to them, but no one was talking on a regular basis our data analytics team."
129,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00771612"
130,1,"So we were the ones everyone would have looked to, and if someone had said,"
130,2,"Well, no, or they disagreed, it would have turned into some kind of argument, because"
130,3,"we would have said, No, you're all wet, like what are you talking about."
130,4,"I don't remember that happening. So! don't think anyone gave a different"
130,5,"assessment of the election at that point."
130,6,"Q- Okay. Thanks. So did you observe any other, even if you didn't"
130,7,"participate, but did you observe any other conversation that night before the President's"
130,8,"remarks about what he should say about the outcome of the election?"
130,9,"A So I'm sure I did observe it, okay, in terms of what was spoken, what was"
130,10,"said. I also don't remember what that was and the likelihood is because my job at that"
130,11,"moment was to give an assessment of the politics of it. I never weighed in on speeches."
130,12,"I rarely weighed in on speeches, because that wasn't my bailiwick."
130,13,"So was! there? Was! present when they were talking about the wordsmithing"
130,14,"of a document and what he should say? Yes. Dol remember what was said? No,"
130,15,"and I probably don't remember because, ""A"", it was a long time ago and, ""B"", I was"
130,16,"probably on my phone, looking at numbers, doing something else."
130,17,"I just didn't -- that wasn't my area."
130,18,"Q Understood. Dol remember who, if anyone, advocated for the President"
130,19,"to say he had won the election?"
130,20,"A I don't remember specifically."
130,21,"Q Okay. Did you later come to learn who had, if anyone?"
130,22,"A No. 1! don't remember, period, who, if anybody, advocated that the"
130,23,"President say those things."
130,24,"Q_ Okay. did want to follow up on one other thing. You said that you got"

161,?,"A Yes."
161,?,"Q_ Okay. And how did he respond to your comments about that, that we"
161,?,"need to be patient?"
161,?,"A Frankly, he was skeptical. He sort of felt something I didn't. I thought he"
161,?,"would win Pennsylvania based on the 700,000-plus margin he had at that moment. And"
161,?,"he just -- he felt he wouldn't. He was --"

161,?,"A Yes, and other States."
161,?,"Q_ Okay. What other States was he afraid he might lose at that point on --"
161,?,"A Well, I mean, we were told that Arizona was called and Governor was"

181,3,"probably 15 to 20 people surrounding this man who has papers. _I don't know what was"

181,6,"Q_ Yeah. Do you recall anyone suggesting that he should declare victory or say"
181,7,"that the election was stolen?"
181,8,"A Not at that point, until we went downstairs, but not up in the residence."
181,9,"Q_ Okay. So when you went downstairs from the residence, did you have a"
181,10,"clear sense as to what he might say, or was that still up in the air?"
181,11,"A No. No,!hadnoidea. She hadnoidea. We got -- it was time to go."
181,12,"They went into the elevator. The White House elevator, from the residence to"
181,13,"downstairs, isn't big. So it was --I don't even know. I know it was the President, the"
181,14,"First Lady, maybe a couple of the kids, and an agent. And then the rest of us, which,"

181,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00786679"
182,1,"A No. And, in fact, it's interesting because the one person who was the"

182,3,"them it was stolen, go out there and say it was stolen."

191,1,"A __ The two processes were slightly different. The White House Counsel"

192,4,"know which one it was. I don't recall a clear direction one way or the other. I do recall"

263,?,"Put us back in the time period right before you're going onto the House floor for a"

263,?,"A Uh-huh."
263,?,"Q Why woulq have been trying to give such documents to the"

263,?,"A I don't know the origin of wherd{ received those documents."
263,?,"Again, in the broader conversation of alternate slates of electors being presented from a"
263,?,"number of the States having already been received, you know, by our office and mailed to"
263,?,"our office, I would have to assume that it was part of that same transmittal of documents."
263,?,"I don't know specifically why Michigan and Wisconsin were not sent via mail, but it strikes"

263,?,"But I don't know what the back story is as to why those were treated differently"

266,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00794788"
267,1,"about that, nor was any question raised about it in the Congressional Record for the"
267,2,"count."
267,3,"There is a newspaper article from a few days after the count where one of the"
267,4,"tellers allegedly told someone that there was an irregularity with the certificate for"
267,5,"Georgia where a page was missing. No question as to the authenticity of the page that"
267,6,"was received. They had simply failed to attach a page that should have been there."
267,7,"It was a technical defect. No question about the outcome. And Jefferson had"
267,8,"not called it to the attention of the larger body, according to the newspaper article,"
267,9,"despite the fact that the teller had expected him to."
267,10,"That was hardly an example of a Vice President asserting authority to decide"
267,11,"disputes over electoral certificates. And that was really the example [EE kind"
267,12,"of pinned most of his hopes on, I suppose, in terms of a historical example of Vice"
267,13,"Presidential authority."
267,14,"So we also walked through the history of all of the different disputes that had"
267,15,"arisen in Congress up to the Electoral Count Act. He acknowledged -- by this point, I had"
267,16,"determined the Nixon example was not a counter example, and he agreed with me that,"
267,17,"indeed, since the Electoral Count Act had gone into effect, there were no instances of"
267,18,"departing from the Electoral Count Act."
267,19,"And we sort of summed it up at the end saying that, so what we have here is an"
267,20,"admittedly not well-drafted sentence in the Constitution that simply does not provide for"
267,21,"the possibility of objections or how to resolve them. It's just not in the constitutional"
267,22,"sentence."
267,23,"The constitutional sentence refers to two activities. The Vice President or the"
267,24,"President of the Senate shall open the certificates, and switches to the passive voice, and"
267,25,"they shall be counted. Doesn't even specify who does the counting."
267,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00794895"
268,?,"So there's nothing about objections. There's nothing about resolution of"
268,?,"objections."
268,?,"So you start with that. And his premise was, well, the Vice President is the one"
268,?,"who does the counting because nobody else is mentioned and the Vice President opens"
268,?,"the certificate."
268,?,"The constitutional provision doesn't say that, but that's his premise. And his best"
268,?,"argument for that is actually a piece of paper that was attached to a copy of the"
268,?,"Constitution that was sent out to the different States."
268,?,"They realized, wait a second, there was something that we forgot about here,"
268,?,"which is we won't have a sitting Vice President come the first count for George"
268,?,"Washington's election as President."
268,?,"And so they recommended that a Senator be appointed to the role of presiding"
268,?,"over that session and serve as President of the Senate, even though they wouldn't have"
268,?,"One, and that he would do the counting."
268,?,"So that was his best example, was that the Framers did seem to think that the Vice"
268,?,"President would have a real role incounting. That's a far cry from resolving objections"
268,?,"or even thinking that there would be objections."
268,?,"So he acknowledged that there was an ambiguous provision with 100 percent"
268,?,"consistent historical practice since the time of the Founding that the Vice President did"
268,?,"not have -- did not ever assert or exercise authority to do what he was suggesting we"
268,?,"should do."
268,?,"And the 130 years of practice of following the Electoral Count Act every single"
268,?,"time. We went through examples like Al Gore."
268,?,"""Are you really saying, J, that Al Gore could have just declared himself the"
268,?,"winner of Florida and moved along?"""
268,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00794896"
269,1,"""Well, no, no, there wasn't enough evidence for that."""
269,2,"So it was a very contingent position in EE mind about all of the"
269,3,"underlying unconstitutional things that he thought were happening in the States this time"
269,4,"around, and it wasn't clear how he drew the line that that worked."
269,5,"But he acknowledged by the end that, first of all, no reasonable person would"
269,6,"actually want that clause read that way because if indeed it did mean that the Vice"
269,7,"President had such authority, you could never have a party switch thereafter. You"
269,8,"would just have the same party win continuously if indeed a Vice President had the"
269,9,"authority to just declare the winner of every State."
269,10,"He acknowledged that he didn't think Kamala Harris should have that authority in"
269,11,"2024; he didn't think Al Gore should have had it in 2000; and he acknowledged that no"
269,12,"small government conservative should think that that was the case."
269,13,"And I said, ""If this case got to the Supreme Court, we'd lose 9-0, wouldn't we, if we"
269,14,"actually took your position and it got up there?"" And he started out at 7 to 2."
269,15,"And I said, ""Who are the two?"""
269,16,"And he said, ""Well, I think maybe Clarence Thomas."""
269,17,"And I said, ""Really? Clarence Thomas?"""
269,18,"And so we went through a few Thomas opinions and, finally, he acknowledged,"
269,19,"""Yeah, all right, it would be 9-0."" Except that his fallback --"
269,20,"Q__ Did he say who the other one was?"
269,21,"A Idon't recall. I don't recall."
269,22,"But he ultimately acknowledged that none of them would actually back this"
269,23,"position when you took into account the fact that what you have is a mildly ambiguous"
269,24,"phrase, a nonsensical result that has all kinds of terrible policy implications, and uniform"
269,25,"historical practice against it. It just didn't work."
269,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00794897"
270,1,"So I kind of wound up, ""Can't we just acknowledge that this is a really bad idea?"""
270,2,"And he didn't quite say yes, but, he said, ""Well, all right. I get everything you're"
270,3,"saying."" He said, ""They're going to be really disappointed."""
270,4,"I don't know who the ""they"" is. You can -- I know what your follow-up question"
270,5,"is going tobe. He said, ""They're going to be really disappointed."""
270,6,"Q_ My follow-up question is, who's the ""they""?"
270,7,"[Laughter.]"
270,8,"A Idon't know. I don't know."
270,9,"He said, ""They're going to be really disappointed that I wasn't able to persuade"
270,10,"you."" And he left."
270,11,"I will say the one other thing that we had a lot of discussion on was the political"
270,12,"question doctrine and -- because once he acknowledged that they would lose in the"
270,13,"Court, he said, ""Well, but I think that, you know, it's a political question and they"
270,14,"shouldn't get involved at all."""
270,15,"And a lot of our discussion was my view, A, that they would because they would"
270,16,"recognize if it wasn't them who was going to step in on a question that -- it's a pretty"
270,17,"easily presented question, right? Here we have a statute, and the question is, is the"
270,18,"statute consistent with the text of the Constitution?"
270,19,"His view was that the Vice -- that the constitutional text has the Vice President"
270,20,"having the sole authority to do the counting, and that with that comes the authority to"
270,21,"resolve objections, and, therefore, anything in the Electoral Count Act to the contrary is"
270,22,"unconstitutional."
270,23,"And indeed, if that's what the constitutional clause actually said, you couldn't have"
270,24,"a statute that was -- that contradicted that authority or removed it from the authority of"
270,25,"the Vice President. But that's where he was."
270,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00794898"
271,?,"But I thought the question of the statute and the Constitution, are they"
271,?,"consistent? That is an easy question for the Supreme Court to weigh in on and to decide"
271,?,"that question, and that although I understood the sort of belt-and-suspenders position"
271,?,"that this kind of conflict between the branches is the kind of thing that the Court has"
271,?,"invoked political question on at times in the past, I didn't think that they would here. I"
271,?,"certainly didn't think that the district court or the D.C. Circuit were going to."
271,?,"And that even if they did ultimately invoke political question, where does that"
271,?,"leave us? And that was a big question that {J never had an answer to:"
271,?,"What happens then?"
271,?,"Q_ Meaning Vice President Pence would pound the gavel and say, ""Trump"
271,?,"wins,"" and then the question of whether it would be accepted by the American people or"
271,?,"what would be left?"
271,?,"A Yes. So you'll have an enraged House of Representatives at least and"
271,?,"probably an enraged Senate, because they had expressed no interest in not following the"
271,?,"Electoral Count Act. I mean, among other things, we had all of these Senators who said"
271,?,"that they wanted to follow the Electoral Count Act and make objections. That's not"
271,?,"provided for in the Constitution either."
271,?,"But if we were to do what EE suggested, it would mean that none of"
271,?,"those debates happened in Congress. None of those Senators would get to make their"
271,?,"objections. We would be asserting we have the unilateral authority to do all of that."
271,?,"And so you would essentially have a standoff between the Vice President and"
271,?,"Congress, a bunch of State legislatures, pretty much all of which had said we have no"
271,?,"interest in revisiting what we think was indeed the outcome of the election in our States."
271,?,"We gathered together in my office a list of statements of Republican legislative"
271,?,"leaders in all the different States that were at issue where they had said, ""The people"
271,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00794899"
272,?,"ft have spoken. We're not going to do anything to overturn that."""
272,2,"So you then send it back out tothem? You'll have litigation flying all around, an"
272,3,"enraged House and Senate, legislatures that aren't interested in actually doing what I"
272,4,"pnts them todo. You'd have total constitutional chaos and with no real exit"
272,5,"strategy to happen."
272,6,"Q I want to make sure I understand what [EE was requesting, though,"
272,7,"because your note says -- your handwritten notes say, “Requesting VP reject."""
272,8,"But as we went through the, what I'll call the longer version of the II"
272,9,"memo, in that there were several different scenarios."
272,10,"So the Vice President could reject the slates that were certified by the governors"
272,11,"of those States and instead choose the Trump electors. He could reject the ones from"
272,12,"the governors and say there are no electors for those States and, therefore, it's, you"
272,13,"know, a majority of the votes cast. There was another scenario where they said nobody"
272,14,"gets to 270 so it goes to the House. Then there's also this idea of you reject the electors"
272,15,"and send it back to the States."
272,16,"At the beginning of the meeting on the 5th, what was your understanding of what"
272,17,"he was suggesting would be done if the Vice President rejected the electors from certain"
272,18,"States?"
272,19,"A So, as you know, there were a number of different procedural mechanisms"
272,20,"that were proposed both by EN and by other people at other times, so it's hard"
272,21,"for me to have a completely clear memory as to which procedure was the one at issue at"
272,22,"which time."
272,23,"Here, with respect to the rejecting of the electors, it was -- to the best of my"
272,24,"recollection, there were -- the end game that he was hoping would happen in"
272,25,"Washington, if we actually rejected, would be, one, if we rejected the one slates and the"

299,4,"EXAMINATION"
299,5,"BY MR. i:"
299,6,"Q__ So, you know, the way I think just to give you an overview, we'll start with"
299,7,"just some general background questions, and then I think we can work our way into the"
299,8,"November and December rallies and then into the January 6th rally. So that's kind of"
299,9,"how we'll block it out."
299,10,"A Okay."
299,11,"Q__ So just to get started, you don't have to give me the full history, because you"
299,12,"have done quite a lot in your career, but can you just give us a summary of your work? I"
299,13,"think of it as grassroots political work, but however you view it, what you've been doing"
299,14,"over these past few years."
299,15,"A Yeah, I mean, that's exactly what it is, is grassroots political work."
299,16,"And I got started. I'm one of the original founders of the modern-day Tea Party"
299,17,"movement, and worked in the -- with Tea Party Express up through 2014, maybe 2015,"
299,18,"doing congressional and Senate races. That's really where I cut my teeth in politics."
299,19,"And then when President Trump ran in '16, I supported him. I was one of the"
299,20,"earliest ones out there publicly. I did a lot of media, and then we had Women for"
299,21,"Trump. And we were just active in, you know, doing what we could to help win the"
299,22,"election. And then after he won, then we started Women for America First to focus on"
299,23,"pushing the America First agenda. And that's where I am now."
299,24,"Q__ Now, I get the sense that in the early days with Tea Party Express, that's"
299,25,"where you got some experience with bus tours. Is that fair?"
299,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00798580"
300,1,"A Yes. I'm called the bus queen."
300,2,"Q- Okay. Allright. I won't call you that but I hear --"
300,3,"A My family rolls their eyes when I say the word bus because they're, like, here"
300,4,"she goes again."
300,5,"Q_ And so talk about that, using the bus as a means to get out and get your"
300,6,"message around. Whyis it something you did, and why has it been effective for you?"
300,7,"A Because I -- we realized early on with Tea Party Express that any one of us"
300,8,"could be replaced on the bus. None of us were the rock stars. It was the bus that was"
300,9,"the rock star. And while we're blessed to be able to travel and go across the country"
300,10,"and be with people and meet people, there are people out, you know, in the middle of"
300,11,"the heartland that aren't able to travel. And they live ona farm, and they don't see"
300,12,"people that often."
300,13,"And so, with the bus, it was -- it was something that everybody got to share a"
300,14,"piece of, you know. And so, it was always successful. People loved it. And it was"
300,15,"exhausting and tiring. But, I mean, it -- we loved it and it worked. And so I think we"
300,16,"built one of the biggest brands in modern -- in modern-day politics."
300,17,"And -- and so, it was, you know, Let's get back on the bus, and Let's do the March"
300,18,"for Trump. And, again, it was, you know, being able to connect with people that"
300,19,"otherwise wouldn't be able to, you know, participate in something."
300,20,"Q_ And doing the March for Trump, is that -- and the bus tour, is that something"
300,21,"you started before the 2020 election, or did that happen after Election Day?"
300,22,"A No. So we actually, the first event we did for the March for Trump was"
300,23,"during the first impeachment. And we had a rally on Capitol Hill. And that was"
300,24,"in -- was that in October 2019, I think, the fall of 2019? And then! think we did"
300,25,"something back at that Christmas to March for Trump on the Hill, and so, we had done"

301,4,"d Mr. SS. Vs. Ss phone number is also in the prior exhibit."
301,2,"vv. And the prior -- I see what you are saying. Yes, absolutely. We"
301,3,"will take care of that."
301,4,"BY MR. i:"
301,5,"Q_ And so, if we look back then when the President tweeted about January"
301,6,"6th -- it is in exhibit 12 on page 5, that ""be there, will be wild"" tweet -- did you have any"
301,7,"idea he was going to send that out, any forewarning? Did anybody tell you?"
301,8,"A What day did he send that out?"
301,9,"Q December 19th. So, before [NJ comes in the picture, this is just"
301,10,"on his own -- it appears to be the President on his own."
301,11,"A No. Imean,no. I didn't know that he was going to send that out. I"
301,12,"mean, until we started -- until I reached out to me -- I think it was the day"
301,13,"after Christmas -- and asked if -- about my connecting with [EM and possibly moving"
301,14,"the event to the Ellipse, I mean, we were just doing an event January 6th at Freedom"
301,15,"Plaza, just like we did in November and December. And, I mean, I had no idea, you"
301,16,"know, what the President was planning or doing at that point."
301,17,"Q_ And, to that point, I am going to flip back really quick to text messages with"
301,18,"HS S't's exhibit 3. And the very last one is, on December 19th, 2020, at 2"
301,19,"p.m., so in the afternoon after of the tweet, you send EM a link to a tweet that"
301,20,"you had put up. Okay? If we zoom in, I will show you. You can see"
301,21,"Keep going. Maybe one more. So there you sent hima link to your tweet. And then"
301,22,"we got the tweet on page 6 of exhibit 12. We can then show that."
301,23,"Okay. If you can go down to the bottom, you can see the time is 1:57 p.m., on"
301,24,"December 19th. So it looks like you send {EEE a link to this tweet just a couple"
301,25,"minutes later. And it just says: We have been marching and fighting for the"
301,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00798632"
302,1,"did not have the permit at that time. But we have been told we were probably going to"
302,2,"get it."
302,3,"Q_ Isee. Could you -- do you know how to spell Ms i last name?"
302,4,"A I think i."
302,5,"Q_ Okay. At this time had you reconciled with EEE and you were"
302,6,"going to work with him on the event on the 6th, or whatever he was doing was separate"
302,7,"from what you were planning?"
302,8,"A Yeah, no, I mean, to this day we haven't reconciled with."
302,9,"Q_ Okay."
302,10,"A He would be -- you know, he would be doing her Periscopes or whatever"
302,11,"live, bashing us, just, I mean, just ridiculous. So, no, I mean, it was -- we just, you know,"
302,12,"moved on and kept looking forward."
302,13,"Q_ You -- you've already talked about. We might as well get it to, that things"
302,14,"changed when you get that phone call from J it sounds like."
302,15,"A Oh, yeah, sof reached out and said we have a mutual friend,"
302,16,"i. and she's been trying to get in touch with you. I think he said, you know, she sent"
302,17,"you direct message on Instagram or Twitter or whatever. And she wanted to talk to you"
302,18,"to see what you thought about moving the event to the Ellipse and possibly having POTUS"
302,19,"come."
302,20,"Well, the whole reason [i was -- was involved was because that second"
302,21,"rally on -- in December, I reached out to and hired them for jumbotrons because"
302,22,"the crowd had been so big that people couldn't hear. So we had the jumbotrons there."
302,23,"SoZ reached out to me, because we had worked together on that event. He"
302,24,"reached out about I, and so I honestly can't remember if I called [J or if"
302,25,"Hi alled J. I just remember that [was -- because we were still at the"

376,2,"A Correct."
376,3,"Q_ Allright. And we'll talk about that."
376,4,"Can you just describe the atmosphere? What were people expecting that night"
376,5,"when you got to the White House?"
376,6,"A ___ I think that there was typically for people who show up there on election"

376,8,"a little bit nervous not nothing what was going to happen with the red wave or the red"

376,10,"Q_ What were your expectations for that night?"
376,11,"A I knew that we were closing. I felt pretty confident that we'd win."
376,12,"Q_ Was it still an open question, though, in your mind?"
376,13,"A __ There is always some degree of doubt. But I felt -- I felt that trend lines"
376,14,"were moving in the right direction, and we'd prevail."
376,15,"Q_ And you seem like a numbers person, J. Is that based on your"
376,16,"analysis of the numbers and the polling that was going on?"
376,17,"A With regard to this, yes."
376,18,"Q_ When you say ""with regard to this,"" what do you mean?"
376,19,"A Meaning that our -- the way that we were closing strong with early vote"
376,20,"returns, the way that early vote numbers -- and when I say ""early vote"" that is a general"
376,21,"early vote or mail-in or any -- or any, any method. But we were doing better than"
376,22,"expected in some places, and Democrats were doing worse than expected in some places."
376,23,"Q_ Okay. Iunderstand that FOX News projected that Joe Biden won Arizona"
376,24,"around 11 o'clock that night. Do you remember when they called it for Arizona?"
376,25,"A Somewhere around that timeframe."
376,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00810901"
377,1,"Q_ After, did that shift the atmosphere or the attitude in the White House?"
377,2,"A Completely."
377,3,"Q  Howso? Can you describe that?"
377,4,"A Because FOX News was the first to go out and say that. Even the CNNs of"
377,5,"the world thought the race was too close to call. And, in particular, our data people"
377,6,"were saying that we would prevail in Arizona. It would be close, but we would prevail"
377,7,"when all the ballots were counted."
377,8,"Q_ Was it kind of anger kind of directed towards FOX News for making a call"
377,9,"more so than, like, disappointment that maybe the campaign lost Arizona?"
377,10,"A Allthe above."
377,11,"Q__ So both, anger and disappointment?"
377,12,"A Both disappointment with FOX and concern that maybe our data or our"
377,13,"numbers weren't accurate."
377,14,"Q I understand that it's been reported at least that Bill Hemmer from FOX"
377,15,"called you before that projection came out. Is that right?"
377,16,"A I forget if it was a call or a text, but I did communicate with him and knew"
377,17,"that they were getting ready to make that call, yes."
377,18,"Q__ Did you say anything in response when he told you that they were getting"
377,19,"ready to make that call?"
377,20,"A __ Yeah, probably wasn't particularly family friendly. I was alittle bit shocked."
377,21,"Q_ Without the unfamily-friendly words, what was the gist of your message"
377,22,"back?"
377,23,"A How can you make this call when even more liberal outlets aren't making a"
377,24,"call like this."
377,25,"Q__Did he express that he was comfortable or that FOX was comfortable doing"
377,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00810902"
378,?,"this based on the data?"
378,?,"A He expressed that it was completely out of his hands, and there was a -- I"
378,?,"forget the term, brain center, war room, or something of that nature, decision desk that"
378,?,"was making it, and he was simply the messenger."
378,?,"Q__Did you pass along this message to the President?"
378,?,"A Yes."
378,?,"Q_ Personally?"
378,?,"A __ It wasa bit of a chaotic night. I don't remember if -- I don't remember if I"
378,?,"was able to personally get to the President before it was announced. Iwasinaroom"
378,?,"full of people. And so everybody heard me say it or announce it in advance of it being"
378,?,"broadcast, but I don't remember the exact order of communicating with the President."
378,?,"Q_ Was he in that room when you announced it out loud?"
378,?,"A Not that I recall. I believe he was up in the residence."
378,?,"Q_ Do you know what his reaction to that FOX News announcement was,"
378,?,"though?"
378,?,"A __ Similar to mine."
378,?,"Q___Did you talk to him about it?"
378,?,"A At acertain point. I don't remember, again, if it was before the on-air"
378,?,"announcement or afterward. Excuse me."
378,?,"Q_ What did he say when you did talk to him about it?"
378,?,"A __ Similar to what I'd expressed to Bill Hemmer, except with a dynamic that"
378,?,"Rupert Murdoch was twisting the knife."
378,?,"Q_ Meaning that FOX News was not being fair to him? _I guess, could you"
378,?,"explain what you meant by that or what he meant by that?"
378,?,"A I think that FOX News wasn't being fair or was jumping to conclusions when"
378,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER $G060810903"
379,1,"the race was still too close to call."
379,2,"Q_ And did the President expect more from FOX News?"
379,3,"A By that point in the relationship, probably not, but I think he was frustrated"
379,4,"nonetheless."
379,5,"Q_ And the major networks didn't call -- actually, I'm sorry. Let me just back"
379,6,"up. Do you remember any specific words he said to you in that conversation?"
379,7,"A Other than certain nonfamily-friendly words, those are probably the only"
379,8,"ones I'd remember from that and Murdoch's name."
379,9,"Q Now the major networks didn't call Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, or"
379,10,"Georgia on election night. Do you remember that?"
379,11,"A I do not remember with great detail when each State was called across the"
379,12,"board. But I know that the race overall wasn't called until Saturday. Yeah."
379,13,"Q_ Fairenough. Now, when you went up to the residence, can you describe"
379,14,"what happened and when that was?"
379,15,"A -- I went up to the residence twice."
379,16,"Q__ Starting with the first time, what happened? And roughly when do you"
379,17,"think you went up?"
379,18,"A Somewhere probably shortly after the Arizona news. Again, I might be"
379,19,"conflating the two trips up. So I just remember that one time there were a lot more"
379,20,"people than the other. There's -- at least with the earlier group, I want to -- I believe"
379,21,"that there were more people, more allies, family members, people like that that were"
379,22,"around. One of the trips had a lot more people; one of the trips had fewer people."
379,23,"Q Okay. And in the fewer trip -- fewer people trip, what happened?"
379,24,"A And, again, I don't remember which one was first, if it was -- I think it was"
379,25,"probably more people initially and then fewer later. But I think the -- both of them were"
379,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00810904"
380,1,"just wanting to know about where the numbers were and where they were -- where they"
380,2,"were tracking with a lot more of the numbers people doing a lot more of the talking, and"
380,3,"at least the first time I remember there was more conversation about calling FOX News to"
380,4,"try to get them to reverse their call."
380,5,"Q__ And was that a suggestion that the President made?"
380,6,"A ___ It was something that we had already started to do, even before we"
380,7,"discussed it with the President."
380,8,"Q_ And when you did you discuss it with him, was that -- did he agree with that"
380,9,"suggestion?"
380,10,"A Yeah. But he was probably even more adamant about redoubling efforts."
380,11,"Q_ Canyou describe that? And it is okay to use unfamily-friendly words. And"
380,12,"we are interested in the discussion that you had and what he said."
380,13,"A I mean, simply that how could FOX go and call this when even the fake news"
380,14,"outlets weren't calling it. It's way too early. Our numbers show that we are going to"
380,15,"win that State, and Murdoch's just doing this to mess with me. That's a summary."
380,16,"Q_ Okay. Nowwere you up in the residence with him as he planned to give his"
380,17,"speech on election night?"
380,18,"A __ The -- thinking carefully here."
380,19,"Q_ Let meask it this way: Did you ever discuss the speech that he was going"
380,20,"to give on election night?"
380,21,"A __ That's what I'm trying to think back to. That was largely being worked on"
380,22,"by I believe [NJ and his team, the speech-writing team. And I don't"
380,23,"remember weighing in -- I don't remember weighing in on the speech details, other than"
380,24,"there was suggestions by I believe it was [EE to go declare victory and to say"
380,25,"that we'd won it outright. And I remember saying that I -- to the best of my memory, I"
380,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00810905"
381,1,"was saying that we should not go declare victory until we had a better sense of the"
381,2,"numbers."
381,3,"Q = Okay. Can you be more specific about that conversation, in particular what"
381,4,"EER Said, your response, and anybody else in the room's response?"
381,5,"A __ I think effectively J was saying: Wewonit. They are"
381,6,"stealing it from us. Where did all the votes come from? We need to go say that we"
381,7,"won. And essentially anyone who didn't agree with that position was being weak. And"
381,8,"I believe {J pushed back on that, said that we'd need more information; we"
381,9,"can't go and declare that. And then a certain point I think there's -- I think maybe i"
381,10,"J maybe got into it with either -- I think it was ES or J. but"
381,11,"HEB was definitely pushing to declare victory."
381,12,"Q When you say {EJ may have gotten into it with I or"
381,13,". (ER, can you be more specific?"
381,14,"A I think some of the commentary may have included a couple of expletives"
381,15,"and may have gotten a little more personal in nature."
381,16,"Q__I'mgoing to ask you to unpack that. Could you be specific about what"
381,17,"happened?"
381,18,"A I think it's more of just a general ""you're not very good at your job or you're"
381,19,"not very smart"" but with extra expletives in there."
381,20,"Q_ And how did (or SJ respond?"
381,21,"A __ Ithink they responded in kind, the same level of passion."
381,22,"Q__ Did the President see this happening?"
381,23,"A I believe it was in a side room. I do not think this played out in front of the"
381,24,"President."
381,25,"Q_ So you said that both you and {i pushed back and said, you"
381,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00810906"
382,?,"can't do that, meaning accept { recommendation to just go out there and"
382,?,"say he won. Why was that important to you?"
382,?,"A Well, I think for a couple of things. I mean, I always strive to be as accurate"
382,?,"as possible, but also there was a concern that if we just went with a blanket ""we won,"""
382,?,"then it might undercut some of the legitimate legal efforts that were -- that were going to"
382,?,"happen later. And, also, we'd have to come up with some aspect of compelling"
382,?,"evidence to go and show that, and it was just too early. We didn't have that all put"
382,?,"together yet."
382,?,"Q__ So there wasn't evidence to support the fact that he had won at least at this"
382,?,"point in the election. Is that fair?"
382,?,"A At that moment. And to be fair, there wasn't evidence that Biden had won"
382,?,"either. It was still very much an election -- excuse me -- in dispute as it took the better"
382,?,"part of a week before a winner was announced."
382,?,"Q Now obviously the President ended up making a speech that night and he"
382,?,"said: This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country."
382,?,"We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. We did"
382,?,"win this election. This is a major fraud on our Nation -- among other things that he said"
382,?,"that night. Did you know beforehand he was going to give -- or make a speech like that?"
382,?,"A I don't remember those specific words. And I don't recall at this time if I"
382,?,"had the opportunity to review the speech before it started. There was very much"
382,?,"a-- there were a lot of things going on that night, including trying to get more information"
382,?,"to better inform our positioning. And I was not active -- I would not describe myself as"
382,?,"an active participant for his speech prep for those remarks."
382,?,"Q_ Okay. And think you just mentioned, though, at that point, there still"
382,?,"wasn't information whether the President had won or lost. Right? In your view?"
382,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00810907"
383,1,"A Correct. Of the election overall, it was too early to say one way other the"
383,2,"other."

383,4,"Anybody in the room?"

383,9,"anyone else that you saw that was in that camp pushing the President to stay that he had"
383,10,"won the election?"
383,11,"A Not that I immediately recall. There were a lot of people that were floating"
383,12,"around. And I certainly was not present for every conversation."
383,13,"Q Okay. And how about you mentioned [EE as someone pushing"
383,14,"back and you as well. Was there any one else in the camp pushing back against I I"
383,15,"(J recommendation that --"
383,16,"—."
383,17,"Q QHRR. And what do you recall I saying?"
383,18,"A Very roughly something along the lines of: We don't know what's"
383,19,"happened yet. We can't definitively declare victory."
383,20,"Q___Doyou recall when EE was saying, you know, ""you should say that"
383,21,"you won,"" what he was basing that off of?"
383,22,"A You'd have to ask IN 2"
383,23,"Q_ Okay. I mean, did he, like, reference maybe any numbers, or, like,"
383,24,"statistics, or anything that he had that made him think that Trump had won?"
383,25,"A __ The concerns vocalized focused more on the fact that we'd been ahead at"
383,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00810908"
384,1,"A I mean, effectively, yes."
384,2,"Q_ Okay. Soon exhibit 33, if you could scroll up to the top."
384,3,"This is a January 5th, 2020, statement from President Donald J. Trump. It talks"
384,4,"about the New York Times report."
384,5,"Is this the statement that we've been referring to?"
384,6,"A Yes."
384,7,"Q_ And how did this cerme to be? Did he ask you, the President, ask you to put"
384,8,"out a statement about this lunch?"
384,9,"A I remember } called the President to make sure that he had seen the story."
384,10,"And I don't remember what stretch of the day I caught himin. Obviously, that was the"
384,11,"night of the Georgia elections, the Georgia Senate elections."
384,12,"So at some point I got the President on the phone and talked through and said"
384,13,"that -- asked him if it was an accurate story or if he wanted to say something different."
384,14,"And he had a much different perspective on how their conversation had played out."
384,15,"Q__Inthe end of the first paragraph there it says, ""The Vice President and I are"
384,16,"in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act."""
384,17,"Did you express any concern that that was not what you were hearing to the"
384,18,"President as he asked you to put the statement out?"
384,19,"A I think the way that came up was obviously the story had been pushed by"
384,20,"the Vice President's camp, but didn't know necessarily who exactly did it or if the Vice"
384,21,"President was -- to what extent he was in agreement. But that was the President's"
384,22,"recollection, was that they were in agreement that the Vice President did have the power"
384,23,"to act."
384,24,"Q__ Understood that that was his perspective. But did you say to him that"
384,25,"that's not what the Vice President's camp is saying?"
384,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-0081 1003"
385,1,"A Oh, I had not communicated directly with the Vice President's camp at that"
385,2,"point, and so I did not say that."
385,3,"Q You later found out --"
385,4,"A We discussed the news story, obviously, we discussed the first cut of the"
385,5,"news story that went up with no statement from the President."
385,6,"Q__ So this is the President's, at least as communicated to you, this is the"
385,7,"President's belief of what happened in that meeting?"
385,8,"A Correct."
385,9,"Q When J contacted you, he was upset. Is that what you said?"
385,10,"A He clearly was not pleased."
385,11,"Q __ Tell us what he said."
385,12,"A What's the process for putting out a statement for a meeting where only"
385,13,"two people are in the room?"
385,14,"Q__ Did he ask you to retract the statement?"
385,15,"A No. He just -- I think it went right to, what's the process for putting out a"
385,16,"statement for a meeting when only two people are in a room."
385,17,"Q_ And he clearly disagreed with the substance, though, right, because he said"
385,18,"the Vice President doesn't agree with this?"
385,19,"A I'm trying to think what exactly he said. I mean, the tone was very clearly"
385,20,"that -- he used some language to strongly infer that the Vice President disagreed with"
385,21,"that take, but I don't remember what that language was."
385,22,"Q_ When you spoke to the President about this story and before you put the"
385,23,"statement out, what was the President's mood? Was he upset?"
385,24,"A I don't recall the -- I don't recall a particular mood. And, again, it was by"
385,25,"phone so! was not with him in person."
385,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-0081 1004"
386,?,"Q_ Fair enough."
386,?,"From what you could tell, did he seem frustrated?"
386,?,"A I just -- I don't remember with enough clarity to describe a mood at that"
386,?,"moment."
386,?,"Q___ Did he comment to you on his thoughts about the President's power -- or,"
386,?,"excuse me, the Vice President's power at the January 6th joint session?"
386,?,"A Well, I mean, obviously, we put that statement out. So I think that's"
386,?,"probably the best reflection of what the President's mindset was at that time."
386,?,"Q__ Did he say anything about being disappointed with the Vice President or"
386,?,"what he thought the Vice President might do?"
386,?,"A I think it was more of usually what he would say is, ""I hope Mike does the"
386,?,"right thing,"" or, ""I Hope Mike says they need to look at all the broadened irregularity and"
386,?,"unconstitutional way that this election was conducted."" So it would usually be along"

386,?,"point after the lunch. But I don't remember how late, though, or early or late it came"

483,1,"a lot of press around him being serious about running. So continued to do television"
483,2,"forhim. He eventually started calling me to thank me for my public support."
483,3,"Q__ Did you take on an official role with the campaign at some point?"
483,4,"A __ That would be the end of 2015, September-October time period, when he"

483,15,"A _ Senior adviser to the 2020 reelection."
483,16,"Q_ And what were you overseeing in that role as a senior adviser?"

483,19,"Q_ And when you say coalitions, what does that mean?"
483,20,"A It is the grassroots outreach support."
483,21,"Q_ And what sort of work in terms of the outreach and otherwise interacting"
483,22,"with the coalitions and grassroots did you do in that role?"
483,23,"A Really just oversee. Because each department had their own director and"
483,24,"deputies and staff, so there were essentially like miniature campaigns within the"
483,25,"campaign. But because I had so much experience in running coalitions and networks, I"
483,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00822307"
484,1,"Q__ As part of your work with the coalitions, was there also a proactive sense of"
484,2,"being aware if someone who hadn't come to you to get vetted was otherwise holding"
484,3,"themselves out as somehow associated with the campaign?"
484,4,"A There were a lot of people who would pretend to speak on behalf of the"
484,5,"campaign, and we would track that. We'd ask them to stop in many cases, but you just"
484,6,"can't police the entire internet."

484,9,"A __ After the November election?"
484,10,"Q_ Uh-huh."
484,11,"A My time ended December 31st."

484,13,"December 31st, what role were you doing, if it was different, or was it the same?"
484,14,"A So during that time period, there were a lot of coalition members, board"
484,15,"members who wanted to stay engaged in the process, follow the constitutional process of"
484,16,"challenging the election. And one of my primary goals, one of my primary personal"
484,17,"goals was to make sure that our specific campaign people did not get caught up with"
484,18,"those who were out there not really carrying our message and kind of going their own"
484,19,"route and -- which is something that we've done throughout the entire campaign, making"
484,20,"sure that they had clear guidance on what would be approved or what would not be"
484,21,"approved."
484,22,"Q__ You, yourself, were you -- did you go out and advocate on behalf of the"
484,23,"campaign and the President or were you still -- were you strictly doing the oversight of"
484,24,"coalitions during this, after the election to the end of the year period?"

485,1,"Q_ Okay. So did the -- so the campaign started to shift its focus to the State"
485,2,"legislators and then the certification on January 6th, right?"
485,3,"A Correct."
485,4,"Q___ Did you have any role in messaging, yourself, on behalf of the campaign once"
485,5,"that shift was made between then and the end of your time on December 31st?"
485,6,"A No."
485,7,"Q__ And did you notice a shift or observe that the grassroots organizations that"
485,8,"had been protesting, that they shifted their focus to January 6th at that time similarly to"
485,9,"the President in the campaign?"
485,10,"A Every -- once the news started coming out at the -- they were announcing"
485,11,"what the next process would be, it was natural for everybody to shift to what was to be"
485,12,"next."
485,13,"Q_ And so on that point, if we look at exhibit 5, these are going to be screen"

485,15,"Do you -- what we have here are { and her Twitter account. And you"
485,16,"see on December 16th -- and I'll just go through a few of these just to set the stage -- she"

486,3,"A Right."
486,4,"Q__ Did you talk to them about this plan before they sent it out or soon after,"
486,5,"that you can remember?"
486,6,"A I don't remember when they told me they were doing the bus. I remember"
486,7,"having a discussion because, prior to the electoral college, which I think it even states on"
486,8,"there, through January 20th, prior to that, there were no plans for the 6th until the 6th"
486,9,"became the next step, and then they rearranged everything for the 6th. But! couldn't"
486,10,"tell you when we had that conversation."
486,11,"Q _ Understood. And if we go to page 3, you see Women for Trump is the"
486,12,"Twitter handle, and I'll tell you, that's actually still the J’ group, even though they"
486,13,"had changed the name but it was still under the Women for Trump name, and sending"
486,14,"out that they were going to keep rolling patriots, never, ever back down, and that was"

486,18,"math here, but what we see here are a tweet by EN. Now, it's actually on"
486,19,"December 19th. That's going to be in reaction to President Trump's tweet that same"
486,20,"day that we'll see in a second."

514,5,"said that there was 20,000 Georgians, Republicans, that voted in the June primary that"
514,6,"did not come out and vote in the November election, and I shared that about"
514,7,"19,000 -- Senator J got 19,000 more votes in the metropolitan area than"

514,24,"they really want to talk to you."" I said, ""We have all these lawsuits going on. It's not"

515,4,"with you?"
515,5,"A No."
515,6,"Q_ So you may have said this earlier, but how did you find out that the"
515,7,"President was unhappy with what you said on the Neil Cavuto show?"
515,8,"A __ That was kind of the inference I got from my deputy, I guess."
515,9,"Q Who got it from iy?"
515,10,"A Right, that President Trump saw you on, you know, FOX News this morning,"
515,11,"so -- got it."

515,13,"as well, was January 2,2021. Does that sound correct to you?"
515,14,"A Sounds about right."
515,15,"Q__ Now, by then, the election results in Georgia had already been certified by"
515,16,"your office, correct?"

515,18,"Q_ And the electoral college had already cast their votes --"

555,20,"Q_ What was the purpose of that phone call?"
555,21,"A He invited me to join the speaker of the house and visit the Oval Office a"
555,22,"couple of days later."
555,23,"Q__ Prior to receiving the call from the President, had you been alerted to the"
555,24,"fact that he might be calling to invite you to the White House?"
555,25,"A Yes."
555,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829368"
556,?,"Q_ How did you learn of that?"
556,?,"A __ The speaker of the house told me that I might be getting a call from the"
556,?,"President of the United States and advised me that my display on my phone would say,"
556,?,"""Spam risk Egypt."" That was my notification for the fact that that might be him."
556,?,"Q__ Was the speaker of the house at the time [EE ?"
556,?,"A Correct."
556,?,"Q And J, did he tell you that he had already spoken to the"
556,?,"President about coming to the White House?"
556,?,"A __ IIbelieve so."
556,?,"Q_ What do you remember specifically J telling you about the call"
556,?,"that he had with President Trump?"
556,?,"A __ Alll remember is, because it was a little surprising getting a notice from the"
556,?,"speaker that he would be calling, and then even more surprising to be on the alert for"
556,?,"""Spam risk Egypt,"" and then he just advised me that he would be asking for whether or"
556,?,"not I would be interested in coming to Washington, D.C., very quickly afterwards."
556,?,"And that was the extent of what I remember about that interaction, because I was"
556,?,"already thinking about the logistics, because it was inferred that it was going to be pretty"
556,?,"quick."
556,?,"Q Did (J tell you what the purpose of the meeting at the White"
556,?,"House was or was going to be?"
556,?,"A No, no."
556,?,"Q__ Soyou said you received a call on the evening of November 18th. Did your"
556,?,"phone indicate that it was a call coming in from Egypt?"
556,?,"A It did."
556,?,"Q_ And was President Trump on the line?"
556,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829369"
557,1,"A You know, there were more than one call -- there was more than one call,"
557,2,"and I do believe it may have been a call or two -- again, I'm just going by memory here"
557,3,"that's not good -- where it might have been a secretary announcing him. But it seems to"
557,4,"me that one was directly from him. But I could be mistaken on that."
557,5,"Q_ Now, the phone records reflect that the call lasted approximately 4 minutes."
557,6,"What do you remember about taking place on that call?"
557,7,"A I remember him introducing himself and inviting the speaker and I to"
557,8,"Washington, to the Oval Office. I also remember him saying, ""If you want to bring along"
557,9,"some of your buddies, some of your colleagues, that's fine also."""
557,10,"Q__ Did he tell you what the purpose of the meeting was?"
557,11,"A No, he didn't. He just -- he not say what the purpose of the meeting was."
557,12,"Q__ Did he ask you anything about the 2020 election in that phone call on the"
557,13,"18th?"
557,14,"A Yeah. He mentioned his concerns about the election and questioned"
557,15,"whether or not we were doing about it, and I mentioned to him that we were indeed"
557,16,"looking into some of the allegations that had been made."
557,17,"Q_ Sothis--I'msorry. linterrupted your answer. I apologize."
557,18,"A I said I responded. He asked that question, and I said, yes, we were looking"
557,19,"into some of the allegations that had been made."
557,20,"Q__ So the call was approximately 2 weeks after the election. Were you aware"
557,21,"at that time of allegations of election fraud being raised in Michigan?"
557,22,"A I was aware of a lot of allegations being made about election fraud across"
557,23,"the State and Nation."
557,24,"Q_ Had you taken any steps as majority leader to have any of those claims"
557,25,"investigated by anyone?"
557,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829370"
558,1,"A We assigned a senate oversight committee the job to begin to outline how"
558,2,"they would investigate some of the allegations in Michigan that seemed to be deserving"
558,3,"of such."
558,4,"Q_ At the time was Senator EE the chair of the oversight committee?"
558,5,"A Yes."
558,6,"Q__ And did you authorize, if that's the right term, Senator [J to proceed"
558,7,"with that oversight committee investigation?"
558,8,"A Yes."
558,9,"Q_ And did he do that?"
558,10,"A He did."
558,11,"Q__ Inthe call with the President, did any of the details of the oversight"
558,12,"committee's investigation come up?"
558,13,"A No."
558,14,"Q_ Anything else you remember about your discussion with the President"
558,15,"regarding election fraud claims in that first phone call on the 18th?"
558,16,"A It was a very brief call. And other than him asking the question of whether"
558,17,"or not we're aware of or looking into some of the allegations and me responding by"
558,18,"saying we are looking into it, I don't recall anything else."
558,19,"Q_ Do you remember if he mentioned any specific allegations that were of"
558,20,"concern to him?"
558,21,"A I do not recall."
558,22,"Q___ Did you end up going to Washington, D.C., to meet with the President?"
558,23,"A Yes."
558,24,"Q___ Did you have any discussions with Speaker NN in advance of that"
558,25,"meeting with the President to sort of discuss what might be the subject or the topic of"
558,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829371"
559,1,"discussion that would come up at the meeting?"
559,2,"A We anticipated that the conversation would likely get to what are we doing"
559,3,"in Michigan to investigate some of the allegations of fraud."
559,4,"We also talked about let's make good use of this time. And so we brought along"
559,5,"with us a formal letter to the President asking for some specific considerations regarding"
559,6,"Federal funding associated with the COVID pandemic."
559,7,"Q___ Did you discuss with [what your response would be if he asked"
559,8,"about election fraud claims in Michigan?"
559,9,"A I did."
559,10,"Q_ And what was -- can you describe what that conversation was with Speaker"
559,?,"."
559,12,"A We both concurred -- it wasn't a long conversation -- that we were going to"
559,13,"simply follow Michigan's laws."
559,14,"Q_ And tell that to the President?"
559,15,"A Multiple times."
559,16,"Q_ Sorry. I'm asking, sir, in the pre-meeting discussions with Speaker"
559,17,"HE. did you discuss the fact that you would tell the President what you just said,"
559,18,"that we will follow the laws of Michigan?"
559,19,"A Yes."
559,20,"Q Okay. Any other discussions with Speaker EM beforehand about how"
559,21,"you might respond to specific election fraud claims?"
559,22,"A No."
559,23,"Q_ Who else besides Speaker accompanied you to Washington? And"
559,24,"then I understand maybe a smaller group of the contingent or the delegation actually met"
559,25,"with the President. Am I correct?"
559,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829372"
560,?,"A You are correct."
560,?,"Q__ Soif you could --"
560,?,"A Goahead."
560,?,"Q_ Yeah. I'msorry."
560,?,"So in that larger group, who made the trip to Washington with you and Speaker"
560,?,"os"
560,?,"A In addition to Speaker J and myself, we had Senators J,"
560,?,"HR, 2c BR, and Representatives NM and ff, and then we each had"
560,?,"our own respective general counsels with us."
560,?,"Q_ And which members of that group actually attended the Oval Office"
560,?,"meeting?"
560,?,"A Everyone except the general counsels."
560,?,"Q__Doyou recall approximately how long that meeting lasted in the Oval Office?"
560,?,"A From the time we left the Roosevelt Building, I think it's called -- Eisenhower"
560,?,"Building -- until the time we got back, it was approximately 90 minutes."
560,?,"Q_ Who else, other than the Michigan delegation that you've described, who"
560,?,"else was present for the meeting in the Oval Office?"
560,?,"A __ Physically present, allI recall is i."
560,?,"Q_ Were there other people who participated by phone?"
560,?,"A Yes."
560,?,"Q Who do you recall participating by phone?"
560,?,"A reo! a 2 is"
560,?,"Do you know EE from Michigan days?"
560,?,"I do know of her from her Michigan days, yes."
560,?,"p Fr LP"
560,?,"I take it, did you invite her to this meeting?"
560,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829373"
561,1,"A I don't think I invited her to the meeting, no."
561,2,"The video went out."
561,3,"Q_ Okay. And I take it the same is true for J, you didn't invite him to"
561,4,"participate in the meeting?"
561,5,"A No. President Trump invited him to the meeting once the meeting started."
561,6,"Q_ And is that true for NM, that she was not present on the phone"
561,7,"when the meeting started?"
561,8,"A Neither {J nor [J were on the phone when the meeting started."
561,9,"Mr. SR. HE, can you hold ona second? We're just having an issue"
561,10,"with the video."
561,11,"Mr Sure. Let's go off the record."
561,12,"[Discussion off the record.]"
561,13,"Mr Okay. We'll go back on the record."
561,14,"BY MR. a:"
561,15,"Q_ So, Senato i. you said the meeting lasted about 90 minutes. Could"
561,16,"you just give us, before we get into the details, just a brief overview of what took place"
561,17,"during that 90-minute meeting? And then I'll want to dig in on some of the specifics."
561,18,"A So we left the Eisenhower Building, made our way across the walkway, went"
561,19,"up through a narrow set of stairs, went into the reception area, which I believe was"
561,20,"immediately adjacent to the Oval Office."
561,21,"Had an interaction with the receptionist for the United States of America."
561,22,"Challenged her on that title that she got, and she showed me her business card. So she"
561,23,"indeed was the receptionist for the United States of America."
561,24,"I don't think we were there more than 5 to 7 minutes. Didn't feel like a long"
561,25,"time. And then we were escorted into the Oval Office."
561,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829374"
562,1,"And Mr. -- President Trump was behind his desk. Came out from behind it and"
562,2,"shook everybody's hands."
562,3,"And then there were seven chairs set up across the front of the desk, and we all"
562,4,"took positions on those chairs. [MJ sat on the sofa behind us. And to the"
562,5,"best of my recollection, he was there for the entire meeting."
562,6,"And then we ran through the cordials. So everybody had a chance to introduce"
562,7,"themselves and where they're from in Michigan and maybe -- I think some of them even"
562,8,"acknowledged some of the committees that they serve on."
562,9,"And then we started, began to have aconversation. Conversation for a while."
562,10,"And then at one point in time, the President got up and went out in the Rose Garden for a"
562,11,"few minutes. I don't know how long. It was 7, 8 minutes maybe. I don't think it was"
562,12,"10 minutes."
562,13,"And then after that the conference call occurred with [i and with I."
562,14,"We did have an entertaining interaction with the fellow that brought Diet Coke in to the"
562,15,"President."
562,16,"Then we finished up our conversations. We concluded with a presentation of"
562,17,"our letter to him and explained the purpose of it. And there were photo ops for all of"
562,18,"the members that were there. One member, I think Senator J actually had"
562,19,"something he wanted the President to sign so he could have a signature from him."
562,20,"And at that point in time, we departed from the Oval Office with EES -"
562,21,"He took us on a detailed tour, a very interesting detailed tour of the Situation Room and"
562,22,"the Cabinet Room."
562,23,"We spent not an insignificant amount of time in both of those locations because I"
562,24,"was full of questions regarding particularly the Situation Room. He went through a"
562,25,"number of scenarios in which he was actually present and personally was able to observe"
562,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829375"
563,1,"with regards to things like rescuing people in remote parts of the world."
563,2,"Then he presented to us some trinkets and souvenirs to leave with. And then we"
563,3,"left. And we did not go back to see the President or the Oval Office."
563,4,"Q_ Thank you for that overview. That's helpful."
563,5,"So I want to focus on the portion, the conversation, what you described as sort of"
563,6,"the meeting starting after that, after the introductions, and so forth, but before the"
563,7,"President went out to the Rose Garden."
563,8,"So what was the -- I assume the President at some point early on in that discussion"
563,9,"announced the reason that he had called you to Washington?"
563,10,"A I don't think there was -- to the best of my recollection, I don't think there"
563,11,"was ever a formal statement of reason for coming, but there wasn't a mystery about it"
563,12,"either in terms of he's inquiring as to what Michigan is doing to investigate the allegations"
563,13,"on fraud."
563,14,"Q_ Can you give us more specifics about what the President said about the"
563,15,"allegations of fraud?"
563,16,"A You know, I'm going to disappoint you a bit because there's not a lot of"
563,17,"specifics that he said that I'm going to remember directly. _ I'm doing the best I can to"
563,18,"remember the essence of the conversations."
563,19,"One thing I do remember is that he never, ever, to the best of my recollection,"
563,20,"ever made a specific ask. It was always just general topics about, you know, did you"
563,21,"hear about this or what are you doing about -- you know. And he would make mention"
563,22,"about Wayne County and TCF Center and all of the video that was shown on national TV"
563,23,"with respect to that and did it in the form of questioning what's actually going on there."
563,24,"He was a bit disparaging about Wayne County. At one point in time I made it"
563,25,"clear to him that he didn't lose Michigan because of Wayne County. And that was -- I"
563,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829376"
564,1,"could tell by his body language that wasn't necessarily what he wanted to hear."
564,2,"Q_ Can Istop you there for one second?"
564,3,"What do you recall him saying that was disparaging of Wayne County?"
564,4,"A ___ Just that all of the chaos going on with TCF Center and the late night band"
564,5,"showing up that everybody has seen a thousand times on TV and the boxes being"
564,6,"unloaded, and then the inference that if none of that had happened he would have won"
564,7,"Michigan. And that's not a true statement."
564,8,"Q___ Did he make comments along the line of Detroit is corrupt or they're corrupt"
564,9,"in Detroit or in Wayne County, sort of broader statements about sort of his views of"
564,10,"Detroit politics, Wayne County politics, or elections?"
564,11,"A I don't recall if he ever used the word ""corrupt,"" but I do think he probably"
564,12,"referenced that Wayne County has a history."
564,13,"Q_ And you said you made some response -- or responded to that by telling him"
564,14,"that's not why he lost Michigan. Do you remember what you said to him in that regard?"
564,15,"A I do, because I have had to repeat it a few hundred times to other people"
564,16,"besides President Trump."
564,17,"Q_ What did you say?"
564,18,"A I said he primarily lost Michigan because of two counties that are routinely"
564,19,"Republican counties, Kent County and Oakland County, and more specifically he"
564,20,"underperformed with educated females."
564,21,"And I'm going to be even more specific. If he had received the same number of"
564,22,"votes as the two winning sheriffs in those two counties, he likely would have won"
564,23,"Michigan."
564,24,"Q__ Sol take it by November 18th, 2 weeks after the election, you already had"
564,25,"fairly specific demographic information about how sort of the votes broke out in various"
564,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829377"
565,1,"parts of the State."
565,2,"A Yes. It was sliced and diced pretty well."
565,3,"Q_ And do you know how he did in -- how the President did in Wayne County as"
565,4,"compared to, say, 2016?"
565,5,"A He actually outperformed considering the increase in voter turnout in 2020"
565,6,"than he did in 2016. It was not enough, obviously, to carry the election. He didn't"
565,7,"underperform in Wayne County if you compare it to 2016."
565,8,"Q__ You said that when you made that comment to him he didn't seem to like"
565,9,"the answer. What made you think that?"
565,10,"A My recollection is he quickly changed the topic and went a different"
565,11,"direction, but don't ask me what that was because I don't remember that."
565,12,"Q Do you remember what he said about concerns about the TCF Center"
565,13,"specifically?"
565,14,"A He's famous for broad strokes. Can you believe all the cardboard that they"
565,15,"were taping up on Plexiglass? And can you believe the yelling and screaming that"
565,16,"occurred? And can you believe they locked certain people out who wanted ostensibly"
565,17,"to come into observe? There was a litany of those things that he was going through."
565,18,"Q__ Did you push back on any of those claims?"
565,19,"A No, because I didn't know enough at that time."
565,20,"Q__ So the meeting was on -- I don't know if we even established this yet -- the"
565,21,"meeting was on November 20th, ona Friday. Is that right?"
565,22,"A Yeah. Yes."
565,23,"Q__ So the evening before, or late in the afternoon before, on November 19th,"
565,24,"there was a press conference that is, and others held at the"
565,25,"RNC headquarters in Washington."
565,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829378"
566,1,"Do you recall that press conference or anything about it? It got a lot of national"
566,2,"media attention."
566,3,"A Yeah, I don't remember any -- I remember many, watching many press"
566,4,"conferences, but I don't remember -- I don't recall any specific press conferences. I"
566,5,"recall seeing EJ on television more often than I care to remember on this topic."
566,6,"Q This is a press conference that got a lot of attention. [NJ had some"
566,7,"hair dye or what appeared to be hair dye running down his face during it. And there"
566,8,"was a lengthy discussion at the press conference by i” 27d SY about"
566,9,"Dominion voting machines and Hugo Chavez. I'm just wondering if that rings a bell for"
566,10,"you."
566,11,"A I can remember iiimentioning Dominion voting machines. I'm just"
566,12,"not sure I remember it at that particular press conference."
566,13,"Q_ And the reason I bring up the press conference is that the Oval Office"
566,14,"meeting was the day after, and I'm wondering whether -- for a lot of people that press"
566,15,"conference left a lasting impression, and whether that was something that was front of"
566,16,"mind for you or came up in the discussions during the White House meeting."
566,17,"A So when he was on the conference call in the Oval Office he was repeating"
566,18,"things that I had heard him say multiple times. Whether or not it was the night before"
566,19,"or not, to me, he hadn't changed his mantra much at all."
566,20,"Q_ Gotit. Okay. Let's move to that part of the meeting."
566,21,"So you had this initial discussion. The President left the Oval Office for a period"
566,22,"of time, a few minutes, less than 10 minutes, and then came backin. And you said at"
566,23,"that point and I joined by phone."
566,24,"Am I getting that sequencing right?"
566,25,"A You are."
566,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829379"
567,1,"Q___ Howis it that they joined the conversation, if you know?"
567,2,"A If I recall correctly, the President hit a button on his phone and had"
567,3,"somebody connect them. He did not directly dial them."
567,4,"Q__ But he requested that they be brought into the conversation, to your"
567,5,"recollection?"
567,6,"A __ Thatis true."
567,7,"Q_ Did the President bring I anc J in at the same time or"
567,8,"was it at different points during the meeting?"
567,9,"A I remembe speaking first. I don't remember if they were on at the"
567,10,"same time or it was one call then the next one."
567,11,"Q What do you remember {EE Saying during that meeting?"
567,12,"A It was no substance. It was a lot of, ""Sorry I wasn't able to be there to see"
567,13,"my friends from Michigan, yada, yada, yada."" But there was no -- to my recollection,"
567,14,"there was no real substance as relates to the election."
567,15,"Q__ Did Mr. -- did the President tell the group why he was bringing Js"
567,16,"into the call? So, in other words, ""Hey, I'm going to get [NE on for X, Y, or Z"
567,17,"reason."""
567,18,"A I don't remember."
567,19,"Q Okay. How about J? = What do you recall his role being in the"
567,20,"meeting?"
567,21,"A __ There was an interaction between the President and us about questioning"
567,22,"how were we looking into allegations of fraud and so forth. And we were -- again, that's"
567,23,"when we were talking about TCF and Wayne County and Oakland County and Kent"
567,24,"County."
567,25,"And I believe the strong inference from both Speake and I was that we"
567,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829380"
568,1,"saw no reason for anything to be done on our end other than to investigate some of the"
568,2,"allegations."
568,3,"And he asked if you'd like to -- no. He asked, ""Would you mind if I dialed in"
568,4,"HE?"" What am I goingto say? Yeah, I don't want jon the phone? So!"
568,5,"think even if I said no, he would have just done it anyway."
568,6,"But that's the best of my recollection."
568,7,"Q_ And when J came on the phone, did you get the sense that he was"
568,8,"surprised to be brought in? Had he been sort of -- did he know what he was getting into"
568,9,"or what you guys were doing when he was brought on the line? I know I'm asking you"
568,10,"to speculate somewhat here."
568,11,"A Yeah. I don't think I recall vividly enough to be able to comment on that,"
568,12,"other than it didn't take him long to get into his routine."
568,13,"Q_ He got up to top speed pretty quickly?"
568,14,"A Yes."
568,15,"Q__ So tell me about what EE said when he got on the line."
568,16,"A He started going through his litany of claims and observations that he's"
568,17,"made and the reasons why, in his opinion, the election was problematic, if not worse."
568,18,"And he went on. He was filibustering, is what he was doing."
568,19,"Of everybody in that room, I'm not so sure he wasn't the one that talked the"
568,20,"longest of all of us for that entire time. He talked alongtime. That's what he was"
568,21,"doing."
568,22,"Q_ And was this -- was the President participating in that part of the discussion"
568,23,"or was J pretty much just on a long monologue?"
568,24,"A He was on along monologue. And so I'm not sure if this was ever talked"
568,25,"about post-meeting, but I may have offended him a little bit because I did my best to"
568,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00829381"
569,1,"interrupt him because he was going -- literally going on and on and on. _‘It was just"
569,2,"getting to the point of uncomfortable."

610,?,"Q_ And when you say too early to be making any proclamation, are you saying"
610,?,"too early to say we've won, because the evidence indicated Mr. Trump lost, or just"

610,?,"Q__ Didn't know either way?"
610,?,"A Too many votes -- too many votes had yet to be counted and the conclusion,"

610,?,"Q__ Did he say why from the PR perspective it was important to make that"

611,1,"get back to the task at hand here. So was -- I was mainly focused on extricating myself"

611,9,"Q Was -- there's reports that he was drinking that night. At"
611,10,"that point, could you tell whether was sober or not?"
611,11,"A I can't speak to that. I never saw him -- he didn't -- he didn't come into the"

611,13,"Q__ And you said originally at the beginning of this conversation that [i"
611,14,"was directed your way. Were you -- did you see yourself as like a gatekeeper, like, we"
611,15,"can't let J say this to the President?"
611,16,"A Yeah, I've been -- I've been, you know, involved in campaigns for 25 years,"
611,17,"and I'm not a -- I'm not a gatekeeper type. It's not my nature to restrict access and"
611,18,"particularly in, you know, around President Trump, who I think, you know, likes access,"
611,19,"likes interactions with folks. So I'm not a gatekeeper by nature, and I'm not a -- I wasn't"
611,20,"a gatekeeper, you know, for President Trump."
611,21,"But on any election night I think, you know, who the President is around is very"
611,22,"important and/or any candidate is around is very important, and he had made a decision"
611,23,"to be upstairs in the residence with the [M. So I was, you know, trying to protect"

611,25,"Q What about i or J or EE, did any of them tell"

612,8,"A Yes."
612,9,"Q_ Okay. And did any of those three try to tell him that he cannot tell or make"
612,10,"this recommendation to the President?"
612,11,"A I don't recall if that was -- if we -- if that was relayed. But we"
612,12,"were -- i BS, EB, 20¢ SJ were united in saying, you know, show us,"
612,13,"show us the numbers. Show us the data. Show us -- show us how you're arriving at"

612,15,"Q_ Another person who's come up is i -———/. Do you know him?"

612,23,"night. Sol was very focused on trying to -- I say I wasn't a gatekeeper. I very much"
612,24,"wanted to restrict access to that room so the actual work could occur."
612,25,"So, yeah, I think he may have popped his head in the Map Room on election night."
612,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00833351"
613,1,"the surroundings. So I apologize for that."
613,2,"Q_ No, that's perfectly fine. I appreciate you saying that you don't recall."
613,3,"Do you remember in that period up in the residence anybody telling Mr. Trump to"
613,4,"just go out and say we won?"
613,5,"A Idon't recall. I was in the, you know, the President's group. You know,"
613,6,"the core from -- from -- from that, you know, interaction in the residence, I mean, heck,"
613,7,"maybe the entire group for that matter, you know, traveled down to the second floor"
613,8,"where conversations were had about what -- what he would say."
613,9,"Q_ What he would say, you're talking about the speech that he would give --"
613,10,"A Yes."

613,12,"A Correct."
613,13,"Q Who was a part of those conversations?"
613,14,"A Let me take a step back."
613,15,"Q_ Yeah."
613,16,"A __ There -- there -- there -- there were conversations about how to"
613,17,"handle -- how to handle the evening in terms of, you know, what to say, if anything, that"
613,18,"evening. And I think there was a belief that, you know, something should be said that"
613,19,"evening, and that -- that was -- that was discussed at that point in time."
613,20,"Q = Okay. Could you be more specific? So you said there were conversations"
613,21,"about a belief that something should be said. Were there conversations recommending"
613,22,"that the President say something in particular and, if so, what was that particular"
613,23,"message?"
613,24,"A My -- my belief, my recommendation was to say that votes were still being"
613,25,"counted. It's too early to tell, too early to call the race but, you know, we are proud of"
613,?,"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER SCO-00833355"
614,1,"the race we run -- we ran and we, you know, think we're -- think we're in good position."
614,2,"And we'll have more to say about this, you know, the next day or the next day, whenever"
614,3,"we had something to say."
614,4,"Q_ And did anybody who was a part of that conversation disagree with your"
614,5,"message?"
614,6,"A Yes."
614,7,"Q_ Who was that?"
614,8,"A __ The President disagreed with that."
614,9,"Q_ Anybody else?"
614,10,"A I don't know. Again, I was kind of squarely focused on him."
614,11,"Q_ And how did he express his disagreement? What did he say?"
614,12,"A I don't recall the particular words. He thought! was wrong. He told me"
614,13,"so and, you know, that they were going to, you know, go in a -- you know, he was going to"
614,14,"go ina different direction."
614,15,"Q Do you remember any other conversations that you were a part of with the"
614,16,"President before he made his speech to the country early the next morning?"
614,17,"A I may have gone upstairs one time, but I -- I don't believe I did. I was -- I"
614,18,"was --I don't believe I did. I was largely relying on the family to relay whatever"
614,19,"information, you know, we thought he needed to know. I was doing my best to respect"

652,16,"going on on December 26th or 27th?"
652,17,"A The immediate -- on the 26th, was finding out like who, what this event was"

652,19,"couple of people saying, do you know -- and I think -- so I don't know what time I left the"
652,20,"meeting, but also doing some research, I found that there were a number websites that"

652,22,"was the Women for America First was one group. And then there was the ""stop the"
